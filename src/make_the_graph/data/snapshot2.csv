presented for the production of massive photon pairs at hadron colliders. All
next-to-leading order perturbative contributions from quark-antiquark,
gluon-(anti)quark, and gluon-gluon subprocesses are included, as well as
all-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid at
next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The region of phase space is
specified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is
demonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for
more detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for
distributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgs
boson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showing
that enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious
selection of events.

  fluid model","23 pages, 3 figures",,,,['physics.gen-ph'],,"  The evolution of Earth-Moon system is described by the dark matter field
fluid model proposed in the Meeting of Division of Particle and Field 2004,
American Physical Society. The current behavior of the Earth-Moon system agrees
with this model very well and the general pattern of the evolution of the
Moon-Earth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossil
evidence. The closest distance of the Moon to Earth was about 259000 km at 4.5
billion years ago, which is far beyond the Roche's limit. The result suggests
that the tidal friction may not be the primary cause for the evolution of the
Earth-Moon system. The average dark matter field fluid constant derived from
Earth-Moon system data is 4.39 x 10^(-22) s^(-1)m^(-1). This model predicts
that the Mars's rotation is also slowing with the angular acceleration rate
about -4.38 x 10^(-22) rad s^(-2).

the correction of Bose enhancement factor associated with the creation and
annihilation composite particle operators. An example is given for a

examined. One of which is chosen to reflect the off-diagonal long range order
(ODLRO). Another one corresponds to a pair projection of a BCS state. On the
side with negative scattering length, we found that paired atoms described by
ODLRO are more bosonic than the pair projected definition. It is also found
that at $(k_F a)^{-1} \ge 1$, both definitions give similar results, where more
than 90% of the atoms occupy the corresponding molecular condensates.

relations of quantum mechanics systems, known as the polymer representation has
gained some attention in recent years, due to its possible relation with Planck

different aspects of the relation between the ordinary Schroedinger theory and
the polymer description. The paper has two parts. In the first one, we derive
the polymer quantum mechanics starting from the ordinary Schroedinger theory
and show that the polymer description arises as an appropriate limit. In the
second part we consider the continuum limit of this theory, namely, the reverse
process in which one starts from the discrete theory and tries to recover back
the ordinary Schroedinger quantum mechanics. We consider several examples of
interest, including the harmonic oscillator, the free particle and a simple
cosmological model.

observations of the Serpens star-forming region. In particular we present a set
of criteria for isolating bona fide young stellar objects, YSO's, from the
extensive background contamination by extra-galactic objects. We then discuss
the properties of the resulting high confidence set of YSO's. We find 235 such
objects in the 0.85 deg^2 field that was covered with both IRAC and MIPS. An
additional set of 51 lower confidence YSO's outside this area is identified
from the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. We describe two sets of
results, color-color diagrams to compare our observed source properties with
those of theoretical models for star/disk/envelope systems and our own modeling
of the subset of our objects that appear to be star+disks. These objects
exhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit with
actively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possibly
debris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extends
down to at least a few x .001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc.
The lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO's from
extra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO's at very low luminosities.
A spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved YSO's are
more highly clustered than the later stages and that the background
extra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation function
as seen in other extra-galactic studies. We also present a table of matches
between several previous infrared and X-ray studies of the Serpens YSO
population and our Spitzer data set.

velocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first
time in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600
km/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the
outer edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion
curtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler
tomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending
from velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed the
theoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and
Norton et al. (2004) for EX Hya, which predict large accretion curtains that
extend to a distance close to the Roche lobe radius in this system. Evidence
for overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed,
confirming the result of Belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya is
present during quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the hbeta and
hgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at the
outer disc edge, while those of halpha were produced due to the flow of
material along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) and
close to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with the

along the manifold, we pull back the stochastic flow on the manifold to the Lie
group via the action, and subsequently pull back the flow to the corresponding
Lie algebra via the exponential map. We construct an approximation to the
stochastic flow in the Lie algebra via closed operations and then push back to
the Lie group and then to the manifold, thus ensuring our approximation lies in
the manifold. We call such schemes stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods after their
deterministic counterparts. We also present stochastic Lie group integration
schemes based on Castell--Gaines methods. These involve using an underlying
ordinary differential integrator to approximate the flow generated by a
truncated stochastic exponential Lie series. They become stochastic Lie group
integrator schemes if we use Munthe-Kaas methods as the underlying ordinary
differential integrator. Further, we show that some Castell--Gaines methods are
uniformly more accurate than the corresponding stochastic Taylor schemes.

Here we point out the potential of chromospheric observations at millimeter
wavelengths to resolve this long-standing problem. Computations carried out
with a sophisticated dynamic model of the solar chromosphere due to Carlsson
and Stein demonstrate that millimeter emission is extremely sensitive to
dynamic processes in the chromosphere and the appropriate wavelengths to look
for dynamic signatures are in the range 0.8-5.0 mm. The model also suggests
that high resolution observations at mm wavelengths, as will be provided by
ALMA, will have the unique property of reacting to both the hot and the cool
gas, and thus will have the potential of distinguishing between rival models of
the solar atmosphere. Thus, initial results obtained from the observations of
the quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12 arcsec) reveal
significant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8
mHz with a tendency toward short-period oscillations in internetwork and longer
periods in network regions. However higher spatial resolution, such as that
provided by ALMA, is required for a clean separation between the features
within the solar atmosphere and for an adequate comparison with the output of
the comprehensive dynamic simulations.

decreases with increasing size, hence convergence of DDA for large enough
scatterers is quadratic in the common range of d. Extensive numerical
simulations were carried out for a wide range of d. Finally we discuss a number

based on restriction of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy ""trimming"") and (ii)
based on filtering of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy filtering). The physical
properties of LBM provide some additional benefits: the control of entropy
production and accurate estimate of introduced artificial dissipation are
possible. The constructed limiters are tested on classical numerical examples:

plasmas (solar wind, interstellar medium, galaxy clusters, accretion disks).
The key assumptions are that the turbulence is anisotropic with respect to the
mean magnetic field and frequencies are low compared to the ion cyclotron
frequency. The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted
into heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC
CASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and
velocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of
the physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically
reduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the ""inertial range"" above the
ion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic
fluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional
and collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,
which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated
with the Alfvenic component. In the ""dissipation range"" between the ion and
electron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave
(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive
phase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the
energy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless
wave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the
phase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the
electron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling
relations are derived for these cascades. Astrophysical and space-physical
applications are discussed in detail.

Chezy law, but also importantly, to study the effects of these factors on the
propagation of undular bores, which are essentially unsteady in the system
under consideration. In particular, it is shown that the combined action of
variable topography and bottom friction generally imposes certain global
restrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of the
leading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolated
solitary wave with the same initial amplitude. This non-local effect is due to
nonlinear wave interactions within the undular bore and can lead to an
additional solitary wave amplitude growth, which cannot be predicted in the

pure potassium atoms and graphite requires use of a description of the graphite
interlayer binding and thus a consistent account of the nonlocal dispersive
interactions. This is included seamlessly with ordinary DFT by a van der Waals
density functional (vdW-DF) approach [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)]. The
use of the vdW-DF is found to stabilize the graphite crystal, with crystal
parameters in fair agreement with experiments. For graphite and
potassium-intercalated graphite structural parameters such as binding

secondary. The system's period is short, $P=2.230736 \pm 0.000010$ days, with
an orbit indistinguishable from circular, $e=0.012 \pm 0.021$. We demonstrate
generally that the surface gravity of the secondary star in a single-lined
binary undergoing total eclipses can be derived from characteristics of the
light curve and spectroscopic orbit. This constrains the secondary to a unique
line in the mass-radius diagram with $M/R^2$ = constant. For HAT-TR-205-013, we
assume the orbit has been tidally circularized, and that the primary's rotation
has been synchronized and aligned with the orbital axis. Our observed line
broadening, $V_{\rm rot} \sin i_{\rm rot} = 28.9 \pm 1.0$ \kms, gives a primary
radius of $R_{\rm A} = 1.28 \pm 0.04$ \rsun. Our light curve analysis leads to
the radius of the secondary, $R_{\rm B} = 0.167 \pm 0.006$ \rsun, and the
semimajor axis of the orbit, $a = 7.54 \pm 0.30 \rsun = 0.0351 \pm 0.0014$ AU.
Our single-lined spectroscopic orbit and the semimajor axis then yield the
individual masses, $M_{\rm B} = 0.124 \pm 0.010$ \msun and $M_{\rm A} = 1.04

nanostructured optoelectronic and electronic devices such as lasers,
photodetectors and nanoscale logic. Spatial order and size order of SAQDs are
important to the development of usable devices. It is likely that these two
types of order are strongly linked; thus, a study of spatial order will also
have strong implications for size order. Here a study of spatial order is
undertaken using a linear analysis of a commonly used model of SAQD formation
based on surface diffusion. Analytic formulas for film-height correlation
functions are found that characterize quantum dot spatial order and
corresponding correlation lengths that quantify order. Initial atomic-scale
random fluctuations result in relatively small correlation lengths (about two
dots) when the effect of a wetting potential is negligible; however, the
correlation lengths diverge when SAQDs are allowed to form at a near-critical
film height. The present work reinforces previous findings about anisotropy and
SAQD order and presents as explicit and transparent mechanism for ordering with
corresponding analytic equations. In addition, SAQD formation is by its nature
a stochastic process, and various mathematical aspects regarding statistical
analysis of SAQD formation and order are presented.

result that takes advantage of differences in rates of expansion in the terms
of a sheaf cohomological long exact sequence to create unique lifts of finite
dimensional invariant subspaces of one term of the sequence to invariant
subspaces of the preceding term. This allows us to take invariant cohomological
classes and under the right circumstances construct unique currents of a given
type, including unique measures of a given type, that represent those classes
and are invariant under pullback. A dynamically interesting self map may have a
plethora of invariant measures, so the uniquess of the constructed currents is
important. It means that if local growth is not too big compared to the growth
rate of the cohomological class then the expanding cohomological class gives
sufficient ""marching orders"" to the system to prohibit the formation of any
other such invariant current of the same type (say from some local dynamical
subsystem). Because we use subsheaves of the sheaf of currents we give
conditions under which a subsheaf will have the same cohomology as the sheaf
containing it. Using a smoothing argument this allows us to show that the sheaf
cohomology of the currents under consideration can be canonically identified
with the deRham cohomology groups. Our main theorem can be applied in both the

depends on cluster half-mass density (rho_h) in the sense that the turnover
mass M_TO increases with rho_h while the width of the GCMF decreases. We argue
that this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function that
initially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporation
driven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between the
observed GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, central
concentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model in
which the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by
-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-known
insensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal
``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significant
variation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-driven
cluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.
Our conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to depend
instead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidal
radii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternative
prescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties
(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable as
rho_h. In all cases, the normalization of mu_ev required to fit the GCMF
implies cluster lifetimes that are within the range of standard values
(although falling towards the low end of this range). Our analysis does not
depend on any assumptions or information about velocity anisotropy in the

background in the F=1 spinor Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), based on an
integrable spinor model which is equivalent to the matrix nonlinear
Schr\""{o}dinger equation with a self-focusing nonlineality. We apply the
inverse scattering method formulated for nonvanishing boundary conditions. The
resulting soliton solutions can be regarded as a generalization of those under
vanishing boundary conditions. One-soliton solutions are derived in an explicit
manner. According to the behaviors at the infinity, they are classified into
two kinds, domain-wall (DW) type and phase-shift (PS) type. The DW-type implies
the ferromagnetic state with nonzero total spin and the PS-type implies the
polar state, where the total spin amounts to zero. We also discuss two-soliton
collisions. In particular, the spin-mixing phenomenon is confirmed in a
collision involving the DW-type. The results are consistent with those of the
previous studies for bright solitons under vanishing boundary conditions and
dark solitons. As a result, we establish the robustness and the usefulness of
the multiple matter-wave solitons in the spinor BECs.

clustering of particles in a freely cooling dilute granular gas. We consider
large-scale hydrodynamic motions where the viscosity and heat conduction can be
neglected, and one arrives at the equations of ideal gas dynamics with an
additional term describing bulk energy losses due to inelastic collisions. We
employ Lagrangian coordinates and derive a broad family of exact non-stationary
analytical solutions that depend only on one spatial coordinate. These
solutions exhibit a new type of singularity, where the gas density blows up in
a finite time when starting from smooth initial conditions. The density blowups
signal formation of close-packed clusters of particles. As the density blow-up
time $t_c$ is approached, the maximum density exhibits a power law $\sim
(t_c-t)^{-2}$. The velocity gradient blows up as $\sim - (t_c-t)^{-1}$ while
the velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp (rather than a shock
discontinuity) at the singularity. The gas temperature vanishes at the
singularity, and the singularity follows the isobaric scenario: the gas
pressure remains finite and approximately uniform in space and constant in time
close to the singularity. An additional exact solution shows that the density
blowup, of the same type, may coexist with an ""ordinary"" shock, at which the
hydrodynamic fields are discontinuous but finite. We confirm stability of the
exact solutions with respect to small one-dimensional perturbations by solving
the ideal hydrodynamic equations numerically. Furthermore, numerical solutions
show that the local features of the density blowup hold universally,
independently of details of the initial and boundary conditions.

space-time expanded around pp-wave backgrounds. According to this property the
space-time lagrangian density evaluated on a restricted set of field
configurations, called universal sector, turns out to be same around all the
pp-waves, even off-shell, with same transverse space and same profiles for the
background scalars. In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial
fields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell
pp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal
sector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to
the pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such results
can also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We also
study such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). In
particular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse
space and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition
relating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive
modes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of this
simplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified on
the two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, an
iterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFT
equations of motion has been discussed. All our bosonic string theory analyses
can be generalised to the common Neveu-Schwarz sector of superstrings.

a future value of chaotic time series from the present one. The mean predictor
error is used in the definition of predictor quality, while the redundancy is

V_{gas}=4200km/s. These are nearly the {\it maximum speeds} that are
accelerable by the gravity of two truncated CDM halos in a Hubble time even

the error bars for the bullet gas speed (5000-5400km/s), and the bullet gas

functionalization by PmPV imparting high solubility and stability of SWNTs in
an organic solvent DCE. Pressure cycling or annealing during LB film
compression reduces hysteresis and facilitates high degree alignment and

  This model undergoes a quantum phase transition from a spontaneously
dimerized phase to N\'eel order at a critical coupling. We show that as the
critical point is approached from the dimerized side, the system exhibits
strong fluctuations in the dimer background, reflected in the presence of a
low-energy singlet mode, with a simultaneous rise in the triplet quasiparticle
density. We find that both singlet and triplet modes of high density condense
at the transition, signaling restoration of lattice symmetry. In our approach,
which goes beyond mean-field theory in terms of the triplet excitations, the
transition appears sharp; however since our method breaks down near the
critical point, we argue that we cannot make a definite conclusion regarding
the order of the transition.

a scaling behavior in the framework of quasi-two-dimension (quasi-2D) vortex
glass theory. However, at \mu0 H >= 5T, a finite dissipation was observed down

Interestingly, the I-V curves at zero magnetic field can still be scaled

effect of self-field due to persistent current and applied magnetic field.

whose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respect
to the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed.
This behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite
to the ""normal"" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was noted
previously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to
the black hole, they were named ""nearly horizon-skimming orbits"". Our analysis
generalizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)
family of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbits
reported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming
orbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial
configuration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing
orbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial
configuration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the
earlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly
horizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxes
based on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to
equatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for
eccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits. We also find that the inclination
change is, in any case, very small. As such, we conclude that these orbits are
not likely to have a clear and peculiar imprint on the gravitational waveforms
expected to be measured by the space-based detector LISA.

population of the galactic globular cluster M5 (NGC 5904) from its very central
regions up to its periphery. The BSS distribution is highly peaked in the
cluster center, decreases at intermediate radii and rises again outward. Such a
bimodal distribution is similar to those previously observed in other globular
clusters (M3, 47Tucanae, NGC6752). As for these clusters, dynamical simulations
suggest that, while the majority of BSS in M5 could be originated by stellar
collisions, a significant fraction (20-40%) of BSS generated by mass transfer
processes in primordial binaries is required to reproduce the observed radial
distribution. A candidate BSS has been detected beyond the cluster tidal
radius. If confirmed, this could represent an interesting case of an
""evaporating"" BSS.

the entanglement entropy of physical systems described by effective conformal

fluid velocity field. While classical vortices can take any value of
circulation, superfluids are irrotational, and any rotation or angular momentum
is constrained to occur through vortices with quantized circulation. Quantized
vortices also play a key role in the dissipation of transport in superfluids.
In BECs quantized vortices have been observed in several forms, including
single vortices, vortex lattices, and vortex pairs and rings. The recent
observation of quantized vortices in a fermionic gas was taken as a clear
signature of the underlying condensation and superfluidity of fermion pairs. In

both the spin relaxation time $T_1$ and the spin dephasing time $T_2$, either

Fermi Golden rule in the limit of weak spin-orbit coupling. However, at high
temperature and/or for large spin-orbit coupling, one has to use the
equation-of-motion approach when many levels are involved. Moreover, spin
dephasing can be much more efficient than spin relaxation at high temperature,

(frustrated); (b) J1, J3<0, J2>0 (frustrated); and (c) J1, J2>0, J3<0
(non-frustrated). The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) technique is
invoked to study the properties of the system in the ground state, while the
transfer matrix renormalization group (TMRG) technique is applied to explore
the thermodynamic properties. The local magnetic moments, spin correlation
functions, and static structure factors are discussed in the ground state for
the three cases. It is shown that the static structure factor S(q) shows peaks
at wavevectors $q=a\pi /3$ (a=0,1,2,3,4,5) for different couplings in a zero
magnetic field, which, however in the magnetic fields where the magnetization
plateau with m=1/6 pertains, exhibits the peaks only at q=0, $2\pi /3$ and
$4\pi /3$, which are found to be couplings-independent. The DMRG results of the
zero-field static structure factor can be nicely fitted by a linear
superposition of six modes, where two fitting equations are proposed. It is
observed that the six modes are closely related to the low-lying excitations of
the system. At finite temperatures, the double-peak structures of the
susceptibility and specific heat against temperature are obtained, where the
peak positions and heights are found to depend on the competition of the
couplings. It is also uncovered that the XXZ anisotropy of F and AF couplings
leads the system of case (c) to display quite different behaviors. In addition,
the experimental data of the susceptibility, specific heat and magnetization

the conditional average is proposed. The analysis of its properties is based
upon a new definition of prediction quality. The joint experimental information
and the redundancy of joint measurements are expressed by the relative entropy.
With the number of experiments the redundancy on average increases, while the
experimental information converges to a certain limit value. The difference
between this limit value and the experimental information at a finite number of
data represents the discrepancy between the experimentally determined and the
true properties of the phenomenon. The sum of the discrepancy measure and the
redundancy is utilized as a cost function. By its minimum a reasonable number
of data for the extraction of the law yo(x) is specified. The mutual
information is defined by the marginal and the conditional PDFs of the

used to indicate which variable is the independent one. The properties of the

down and falls on the galaxy within metal-rich droplets. Full mixing of these

optimally reproduce the forces and energies in a set of suitably chosen
reference configurations. These reference data are calculated with ab-initio
methods. As a first application, EAM potentials for decagonal Al-Ni-Co,
icosahedral Ca-Cd, and both icosahedral and decagonal Mg-Zn quasicrystals have
been constructed. The influence of the potential range and degree of
specialisation on the accuracy and other properties is discussed and compared.

0704.0164,On smooth foliations with Morse singularities,"15 pages, 14 figures",,,,['math.GT'],,"  Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and let $\F$ be a codimension one, $C^\infty$
foliation on $M$, with isolated singularities of Morse type. The study and
classification of pairs $(M,\F)$ is a challenging (and difficult) problem. In
this setting, a classical result due to Reeb \cite{Reeb} states that a manifold
admitting a foliation with exactly two center-type singularities is a sphere.
In particular this is true if the foliation is given by a function. Along these
lines a result due to Eells and Kuiper \cite{Ku-Ee} classify manifolds having a
real-valued function admitting exactly three non-degenerate singular points. In
the present paper, we prove a generalization of the above mentioned results. To
do this, we first describe the possible arrangements of pairs of singularities
and the corresponding codimension one invariant sets, and then we give an
elimination procedure for suitable center-saddle and some saddle-saddle
configurations (of consecutive indices). In the second part, we investigate if
other classical results, such as Haefliger and Novikov (Compact Leaf) theorems,
proved for regular foliations, still hold true in presence of singularities. At
this purpose, in the singular set, $Sing(\F)$ of the foliation $\F$, we
consider {\em{weakly stable}} components, that we define as those components
admitting a neighborhood where all leaves are compact. If $Sing(\F)$ admits
only weakly stable components, given by smoothly embedded curves diffeomorphic
to $S^1$, we are able to extend Haefliger's theorem. Finally, the existence of
a closed curve, transverse to the foliation, leads us to state a Novikov-type
result.

one-loop lifting of the accidental classical flat directions by direct
computation of the pseudomoduli masses via Feynman diagrams. This new approach
allows to obtain analytic results for all these theories. This work extends the
results for the $dP_1$ theory in hep-th/0607218. The new approach allows to
generalize the computation to general examples of DSB branes, and for arbitrary

Reparametrization Invariance proves appropriate to understand those issues. We

through the use of several adequate parametrizations, showing that there is no
relevant discrepancy between frequentist and bayesian results. The most

The calculated transmission spectra of two configurations are strikingly
distinctive. The open form lacks any significant transmission peak within a
wide energy window, while the closed structure has two significant transmission
peaks on the both sides of the Fermi level. The electronic transport properties
of the molecular junction with closed structure under a small bias voltage are
mainly determined by the tail of the transmission peak contributed unusually by
the perturbed lowest perturbed unoccupied molecular orbital. The calculated
on-off ratio of currents between the closed and open configurations is about
two orders of magnitude, which reproduces the essential features of the

the two quasars whose intergalactic HeII forest has been resolved with FUSE. By
analysing the HI and the HeII opacity variations separately, no transverse
proximity effect is detected near three foreground quasars of HE2347-4342:
QSOJ23503-4328 (z=2.282, $\vartheta=3.59$ arcmin), QSOJ23500-4319 (z=2.302,
$\vartheta=8.77$ arcmin) and QSOJ23495-4338 (z=2.690, $\vartheta=16.28$
arcmin). This is primarily due to line contamination and overdensities probably
created by large-scale structure. By comparing the HI absorption and the
corresponding HeII absorption, we estimated the fluctuating spectral shape of
the extragalactic UV radiation field along this line of sight. We find that the
UV spectral shape near HE2347-4342 and in the projected vicinity of the three
foreground quasars is statistically harder than expected from UV background
models dominated by quasars. In addition, we find three highly ionised metal
line systems near the quasars. However, they do not yield further constraints
on the shape of the ionising field. We conclude that the foreground quasars
show a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening of
the UV radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for QSOJ23495-4338.
Thus, the relative spectral hardness traces the proximity effect also in
overdense regions prohibiting the traditional detection in the HI forest.
Furthermore, we emphasise that softening of quasar radiation by radiative
transfer in the intergalactic medium is important to understand the observed
spectral shape variations. From the transverse proximity effect of
QSOJ23495-4338 we obtain a lower limit on the quasar lifetime of ~25 Myr.

  From the comparison between the zenith angle distributon of the emitted muons

function in as yet unexplored fashion. Our analysis of the complete Protein
Data Bank reveals several new knots which, along with previously discovered
ones, can shed light on such connections. In particular, we identify the most
complex knot discovered to date in human ubiquitin hydrolase, and suggest that
its entangled topology protects it against unfolding and degradation by the
proteasome. Knots in proteins are typically preserved across species and
sometimes even across kingdoms. However, we also identify a knot which only
appears in some transcarbamylases while being absent in homologous proteins of
similar structure. The emergence of the knot is accompanied by a shift in the
enzymatic function of the protein. We suggest that the simple insertion of a
short DNA fragment into the gene may suffice to turn an unknotted into a
knotted structure in this protein.

The SET plays a role of the fluctuating environment affecting the qubit's
parameters in a controllable way. We derive the rate equations describing

Solving these equation we obtain decoherence and relaxation rates of the qubit,
as well as the spectral density of the fluctuating qubit's parameters. We found
that in the weak coupling regime the decoherence and relaxation rates are
directly related to the spectral density taken at Rabi or at zero frequency,
depending on what a particular qubit's parameters is fluctuating. This relation
holds also in the presence of weak back-action of the qubit on the fluctuating
environment. In the case of strong back-action, such simple relationship no
longer holds, even if the qubit-SET coupling is small. It does not hold either
in the strong-coupling regime, even in the absence of the back-action. In
addition, we found that our model predicts localization of the qubit in the
strong-coupling regime, resembling that of the spin-boson model.

the disordered phase their number is small. Lynch proved the conjecture only
for networks with connectivity two and non-uniform probabilities for the
Boolean functions. We show how to apply the proof to networks with arbitrary
connectivity $K$ and to random networks with biased Boolean functions. It turns
out that in these cases Lynch's parameter $\lambda$ is equivalent to the
expectation of average sensitivity of the Boolean functions used to construct
the network. Hence we can apply a known theorem for the expectation of the
average sensitivity. In order to prove the results for networks with biased
functions, we deduct the expectation of the average sensitivity when only
functions with specific connectivity and specific bias are chosen at random.

is ""minimal"" in the sense that the sum of the ranks of the $T_i$'s,
$i=1,2,...,d$, equals the rank of $W$. For the exceptional types, these
decomposition numbers have been computed by the first author. The type $A_n$
decomposition numbers have been computed by Goulden and Jackson, albeit using a
somewhat different language. We explain how to extract the type $B_n$
decomposition numbers from results of B\'ona, Bousquet, Labelle and Leroux on
map enumeration. Our formula for the type $D_n$ decomposition numbers is new.
These results are then used to determine, for a fixed positive integer $l$ and
fixed integers $r_1\le r_2\le ...\le r_l$, the number of multi-chains $\pi_1\le
\pi_2\le ...\le \pi_l$ in Armstrong's generalised non-crossing partitions
poset, where the poset rank of $\pi_i$ equals $r_i$, and where the ""block
structure"" of $\pi_1$ is prescribed. We demonstrate that this result implies
all known enumerative results on ordinary and generalised non-crossing
partitions via appropriate summations. Surprisingly, this result on multi-chain
enumeration is new even for the original non-crossing partitions of Kreweras.
Moreover, the result allows one to solve the problem of rank-selected chain
enumeration in the type $D_n$ generalised non-crossing partitions poset, which,
in turn, leads to a proof of Armstrong's $F=M$ Conjecture in type $D_n$.

cluster. Our Spitzer census supplemented by ground based spectra has added 42
class II T-Tauri sources to the cluster membership and identified ~20 class 0/I
protostars. The population of IC 348 likely exceeds 400 sources after
accounting statistically for unidentified diskless members. Our Spitzer census
of IC 348 reveals a population of protostars that is anti-correlated spatially
with the T-Tauri members, which comprise the centrally condensed cluster around
a B star. The protostars are instead found mostly at the cluster periphery
about 1 pc from the B star and spread out along a filamentary ridge. We find
that the star formation rate in this protostellar ridge is consistent with that
rate which built the exposed cluster while the presence of fifteen cold,
starless, millimeter cores intermingled with this protostellar population
indicates that the IC 348 nebula has yet to finish forming stars. We show that
the IC 348 cluster is of order 3-5 crossing times old, and, as evidenced by its
smooth radial profile and confirmed mass segregation, is likely relaxed. While
it seems apparent that the current cluster configuration is the result of
dynamical evolution and its primordial structure has been erased, our findings
support a model where embedded clusters are built up from numerous smaller
sub-clusters. Finally, the results of our Spitzer census indicate that the
supposition that star formation must progress rapidly in a dark cloud should
not preclude these observations that show it can be relatively long lived.

activates the strongest channel modes. Here we analyze the performance of
Random Vector Quantization (RVQ), in which the precoding matrix is selected
from a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributed
entries. We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver,
which relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to the
transmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity of
beamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large system
refers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all go
to infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,
i.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. The
performance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalar
quantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a random
subspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, and
approximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers
(matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples show
that these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-size
systems of interest. Given a target spectral efficiency, numerical examples
show that the amount of feedback required by the linear MMSE receiver is only
slightly more than that required by the optimal receiver, whereas the matched
filter can require significantly more feedback.

X-ray emission from G328.4+0.2 comes from a region significantly smaller than

approach to the P vs. NP and related problems through algebraic geometry and
representation theory. The basic principle behind this approach is called the
flip. In essence, it reduces the negative hypothesis in complexity theory (the
lower bound problems), such as the P vs. NP problem in characteristic zero, to
the positive hypothesis in complexity theory (the upper bound problems):
specifically, to showing that the problems of deciding nonvanishing of the
fundamental structural constants in representation theory and algebraic
geometry, such as the well known plethysm constants--or rather certain relaxed
forms of these decision probelms--belong to the complexity class P. In this
article, we suggest a plan for implementing the flip, i.e., for showing that
these relaxed decision problems belong to P. This is based on the reduction of
the preceding complexity-theoretic positive hypotheses to mathematical
positivity hypotheses: specifically, to showing that there exist positive
formulae--i.e. formulae with nonnegative coefficients--for the structural
constants under consideration and certain functions associated with them. These
turn out be intimately related to the similar positivity properties of the
Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the multiplicative structural constants of the
canonical (global crystal) bases in the theory of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum
groups. The known proofs of these positivity properties depend on the Riemann
hypothesis over finite fields and the related results. Thus the reduction here,
in conjunction with the flip, in essence, says that the validity of the P vs.
NP conjecture in characteristic zero is intimately linked to the Riemann
hypothesis over finite fields and related problems.

observations of two candidate V-type asteroids, (7472) Kumakiri and (10537)
1991 RY16, located in the outer Main Belt (a > 2.85 UA). These candidate have
been previously identified by Roig and Gil-Hutton (2006, Icarus 183, 411) using
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey colors. The spectroscopic observations have been
obtained at the Calar Alto Observatory, Spain, during observational runs in
November and December 2006. The spectra of these two asteroids show the steep
slope shortwards of 0.70 microns and the deep absorption feature longwards of
0.75 microns that are characteristic of V-type asteroids. However, the presence
of a shallow but conspicuous absorption band around 0.65 microns opens some
questions about the actual mineralogy of these two asteroids. Such band has
never been observed before in basaltic asteroids with the intensity we detected
it. We discuss the possibility for this shallow absorption feature to be caused
by the presence of chromium on the asteroid surface. Our results indicate that,
together with (1459) Magnya, asteroids (7472) Kumakiri and (10537) 1991 RY16
may be the only traces of basaltic material found up to now in the outer Main

important and unique opportunity for the discovery and characterization of
exo-planets. Currently, the Very Long Baseline Array can routinely achieve
better than 100 microarcsecond accuracy, and can approach 10 microarcsecond
with careful calibration. We describe here RIPL, the Radio Interferometric
PLanet search, a new program with the VLBA and the Green Bank 100 m telescope
that will survey 29 low-mass, active stars over 3 years with sub-Jovian planet
mass sensitivity at 1 AU. An upgrade of the VLBA bandwidth will increase
astrometric accuracy by an order of magnitude. Ultimately, the colossal
collecting area of the Square Kilometer Array could push astrometric accuracy
to 1 microarcsecond, making detection and characterizaiton of Earth mass
planets possible.
  RIPL and other future radio astrometric planet searches occupy a unique
volume in planet discovery and characterization parameter space. The parameter
space of astrometric searches gives greater sensitivity to planets at large
radii than radial velocity searches. For the VLBA and the expanded VLBA, the
targets of radio astrometric surveys are by necessity nearby, low-mass, active
stars, which cannot be studied efficiently through the radial velocity method,
coronagraphy, or optical interferometry. For the SKA, detection sensitivity
will extend to solar-type stars. Planets discovered through radio astrometric
methods will be suitable for characterization through extreme adaptive optics.
  The complementarity of radio astrometric techniques with other methods

nanometer-sized spherical cavity in water is presented by a modification of the

dynamics simulations. Quantitative agreement is found between the two
approaches for the time-dependent cavity radius $R(t)$ at different solvent
conditions while in the continuum picture the solvent viscosity has to be
corrected for curvature effects. The typical magnitude of the interface or
collapse velocity is found to be given by the ratio of surface tension and
fluid viscosity, $v\simeq\gamma/\eta$, while the curvature correction
accelerates collapse dynamics on length scales below the equilibrium crossover
scales ($\sim$1nm). The study offers a starting point for an efficient implicit
modeling of water dynamics in aqueous nanoassembly and protein systems in

  (Invisibility)","The presentation of the results has been simplified. Comments and

possibility of cloaking objects from the observation by electromagnetic waves.
The basic idea of these invisibility devices \cite{glu1, glu2, le},\cite{pss1}
is to use anisotropic {\it transformation media} whose permittivity and
permeability $\var^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}$, are obtained from the ones,
$\var_0^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}_0$, of isotropic media, by singular
transformations of coordinates. In this paper we study electromagnetic cloaking
in the time-domain using the formalism of time-dependent scattering theory.
This formalism allows us to settle in an unambiguous way the mathematical
problems posed by the singularities of the inverse of the permittivity and the
permeability of the {\it transformation media} on the boundary of the cloaked
objects. We write Maxwell's equations in Schr\""odinger form with the
electromagnetic propagator playing the role of the Hamiltonian. We prove that
the electromagnetic propagator outside of the cloaked objects is essentially
self-adjoint. Moreover, the unique self-adjoint extension is unitarily
equivalent to the electromagnetic propagator in the medium
$\var_0^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}_0$. Using this fact, and since the
coordinate transformation is the identity outside of a ball, we prove that the
scattering operator is the identity. Our results give a rigorous proof that the
construction of \cite{glu1, glu2, le}, \cite{pss1} perfectly cloaks passive and
active devices from observation by electromagnetic waves. Furthermore, we prove
cloaking for general anisotropic materials. In particular, our results prove
that it is possible to cloak objects inside general crystals.

predictions of a baseline self-stirring model and show how dynamical
perturbations from a stellar flyby or stirring by a giant planet modify the
evolution. Although robust comparisons between observations and theory require
better KBO statistics and more comprehensive calculations, the data are broadly
consistent with KBO formation in a massive disk followed by substantial
collisional grinding and dynamical ejection. However, there are important
problems reconciling the results of coagulation and dynamical calculations.
Contrasting our current understanding of the evolution of KBOs and asteroids
suggests that additional observational constraints, such as the identification
of more dynamical families of KBOs (like the 2003 EL61 family), would provide
additional information on the relative roles of collisional grinding and
dynamical ejection in the Kuiper Belt. The uncertainties also motivate
calculations that combine collisional and dynamical evolution, a `unified'
calculation that should give us a better picture of KBO formation and
evolution.

lensing, and optical observations with numerical simulations of the merging
galaxy cluster 1E0657-56. X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like subcluster
with a prominent bow shock, while lensing results show that the positions of
the total mass peaks are consistent with the centroids of the collisionless
galaxies (and inconsistent with the X-ray brightness peaks). Previous studies,
based on older observational datasets, have placed upper limits on the
self-interaction cross-section of dark matter per unit mass, sigma/m, using
simplified analytic techniques. In this work, we take advantage of new,
higher-quality observational datasets by running N-body simulations of
1E0657-56 that include the effects of self-interacting dark matter, and
comparing the results with observations. Furthermore, the recent data allow for
a new independent method of constraining sigma/m, based on the non-observation
of an offset between the bullet subcluster mass peak and galaxy centroid. This
new method places an upper limit (68% confidence) of sigma/m < 1.25 cm^2/g. If
we make the assumption that the subcluster and the main cluster had equal
mass-to-light ratios prior to the merger, we derive our most stringent
constraint of sigma/m < 0.7 cm^2/g, which comes from the consistency of the
subcluster's observed mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster's, and with the
universal cluster value, ruling out the possibility of a large fraction of dark
matter particles being scattered away due to collisions. Our limit is a slight
improvement over the previous result from analytic estimates, and rules out
most of the 0.5 - 5cm^2/g range invoked to explain inconsistencies between the
standard collisionless cold dark matter model and observations.

months, days and hours. We made our observations with the robotic 60 cm
telescope REM located at La Silla, Chile. VRIJHK filters were used. PKS
2155-304 was observed from May to December 2005. The wavelength interval
explored, the total number of photometric points and the short integration time
render our photometry substantially superior to previous ones for this source.
On the basis of the intensity and colour we distinguish three different states
of the source, each of duration of months, which include all those described in
the literature. In particular, we report the highest state ever detected in the
H band. The source varied by a factor of 4 in this band, much more than in the
V band (a factor ~2). The source softened with increasing intensity, contrary
to the general pattern observed in the UV-X-ray bands. On five nights of
November we had nearly continuous monitoring for 2-3 hours. A variability
episode with a time scale of ~24 h is well documented, a much more rapid flare
with t=1-2 h, is also apparent, but is supported by relatively few points.

We are now beginning to see variety among SNe IIn in their polarimetric

angle effects. The increasing number of known ""hybrid"" SNe with IIn-like
emission lines suggests that circumstellar material may be more common around

The spectrum is characterized by a blue continuum on which are superimposed
broad emission lines of HI and HeII and a host of narrower absorption lines of
neutral metals and molecules. Spectral type standard star spectra scaled to the
dereddened spectrum of A0620-00 in K exceed the A0620-00 spectrum in J and H
for all stars of spectral type K7V or earlier, demonstrating that the donor
star, unless later than K7V, cannot be the sole NIR flux source in A0620-00. In
addition, the atomic absorption lines in the K3V spectrum are too weak with
respect to those of A0620-00 even at 100% donor star contribution, restricting
the spectral type of the donor star in A0620-00 to later than K3V. Comparison
of the A0620-00 spectrum to scaled K star spectra indicates that the CO
absorption features are significantly weaker in A0620-00 than in field dwarf
stars. Fits of scaled model spectra of a Roche lobe-filling donor star to the
spectrum of A0620-00 show that the best match to the CO absorption lines is
obtained when the C abundance is reduced to [C/H] = -1.5. The donor star
contribution in the H waveband is determined to be 82+-2%. Combined with
previous published results from Froning & Robinson (2001) and Marsh et al.
(1994), this gives a precise mass for the black hole in A0620-00 of M_BH =
9.7+-0.6 M_solar.

monitoring campaign from July 2003 till April 2004. The spectral energy
distribution (SED) was measured over the entire electromagnetic spectrum, with
flux measurements from radio to X-ray frequencies and upper limits in the very
high energy (VHE) gamma-ray regime. Here, we use a time-dependent leptonic jet
model to reproduce the SED and optical spectral variability observed during our
multiwavelength campaign. Our model simulations could successfully reproduce
the observed SED and optical light curves and predict an intrinsic cutoff value
for the VHE gamma-ray emission at ~ 4 GeV. The effect of the optical depth due
to the intergalactic infrared background radiation (IIBR) on the peak of the
high-energy component of 3C 66A was found to be negligible. Also, the presence
of a broad line region (BLR) in the case of 3C 66A may play an important role
in the emission of gamma-ray photons when the emission region is very close to
the central engine, but further out, the production mechanism of hard X-ray and
gamma-ray photons becomes rapidly dominated by synchrotron self-Compton
emission. We further discuss the possibility of an observable X-ray spectral
variability pattern. The simulated results do not predict observable hysteresis
patterns in the optical or soft X-ray regimes for major flares on multi-day

planetary formation mechanisms. Aims: This motivates planet searches around
stars which are significantly more massive or less massive than the Sun, and in
particular our radial velocity search for planets around very-low mass stars.
Methods: As part of that program, we obtained measurements of GJ 674, an M2.5
dwarf at d=4.5 pc, which have a dispersion much in excess of their internal
errors. An intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess dispersion
is due to two superimposed coherent signals, with periods of 4.69 and 35 days.
Results: These data are well described by a 2-planet Keplerian model where each
planet has a ~11 Mearth minimum mass. A careful analysis of the (low level)
magnetic activity of GJ 674 however demonstrates that the 35-day period
coincides with the stellar rotation period. This signal therefore originates in
a spot inhomogeneity modulated by stellar rotation. The 4.69-day signal on the
other hand is caused by a bona-fide planet, GJ 674b. Conclusion: Its detection
adds to the growing number of Neptune-mass planets around M-dwarfs, and
reinforces the emerging conclusion that this mass domain is much more populated
than the jovian mass range. We discuss the metallicity distributions of M dwarf
with and without planets and find a low 11% probability that they are drawn
from the same parent distribution. Moreover, we find tentative evidence that
the host star metallicity correlates with the total mass of their planetary
system.

the cosmic microwave background, indicating the presence of widespread warm
molecular gas at intermediate densities. Overall, the distributions of H$_2$CO

differences exist at small scales. Most notably, while the CO peak is nearly
coincident with the S140 H${\alpha}$ arc, the maximum H$_2$CO absorption is
clearly separated from it by a full 10$'$ beam ($\sim$ 3 pc). We argue that
these differences result from differing abundances and excitation requirements.

envelope of a donor star engulfs a much denser companion, and the core of the
donor plus the dense companion star spiral inward through this dissipative
envelope. As conceived by Paczynski and Ostriker, this process must be
responsible for the creation of short-period binaries with degenerate
components, and, indeed, it has proven capable of accounting for short-period
binaries containing one white dwarf component. However, attempts to reconstruct
the evolutionary histories of close double white dwarfs have proven more
problematic, and point to the need for enhanced systemic mass loss, either
during the close of the first, slow episode of mass transfer that produced the
first white dwarf, or during the detached phase preceding the final, common
envelope episode. The survival of long-period interacting binaries with massive
white dwarfs, such as the recurrent novae T CrB and RS Oph, also presents
interpretative difficulties for simple energetic treatments of common envelope
evolution. Their existence implies that major terms are missing from usual
formulations of the energy budget for common envelope evolution. The most
plausible missing energy term is the energy released by recombination in the
common envelope, and, indeed, a simple reformulation the energy budget
explicitly including recombination resolves this issue.

models range from 5% to 50%. Simulations are performed with the NBODY4 code and
include a full mass spectrum of stars, stellar evolution, binary evolution and
the tidal field of the Galaxy. We find that the overall binary fraction of a
cluster almost always remains close to the primordial value, except at late
times when a cluster is near dissolution. A critical exception occurs in the
central regions where we observe a marked increase in binary fraction with time
-- a simulation starting with 100000 stars and 5% binaries reached a core
binary frequency as high as 40% at the end of the core-collapse phase
(occurring at 16 Gyr with ~20000 stars remaining). Binaries are destroyed in
the core by a variety of processes as a cluster evolves, but the combination of
mass-segregation and creation of new binaries in exchange interactions produces

into and out of cluster cores in a manner that is analogous to convection in

particles as seeds in an iterative search for stable cones. A longstanding
infrared (IR) unsafety issue in such algorithms is often assumed to be solvable
by adding extra `midpoint' seeds, but actually is just postponed to one order
higher in the coupling. A proper solution is to switch to an exact seedless
cone algorithm, one that provably identifies all stable cones. The only
existing approach takes N 2^N time to find jets among N particles, making it
unusable at hadron level. This can be reduced to N^2 ln(N) time, leading to
code (SISCone) whose speed is similar to that of public midpoint
implementations. Monte Carlo tests provide a strong cross-check of an
analytical proof of the IR safety of the new algorithm, and the absence of any
'R_{sep}' issue implies a good practical correspondence between parton and
hadron levels. Relative to a midpoint cone, the use of an IR safe seedless
algorithm leads to modest changes for inclusive jet spectra, mostly through
reduced sensitivity to the underlying event, and significant changes for some
multi-jet observables.

(CO) white dwarfs. The dynamical evolution of a 0.9 Msun + 0.6 Msun CO white
dwarf merger is followed by a three-dimensional SPH simulation. We use an
elaborate prescription in which artificial viscosity is essentially absent,
unless a shock is detected, and a much larger number of SPH particles than
earlier calculations. Based on this simulation, we suggest that the central
region of the merger remnant can, once it has reached quasi-static equilibrium,
be approximated as a differentially rotating CO star, which consists of a
slowly rotating cold core and a rapidly rotating hot envelope surrounded by a
centrifugally supported disc. We construct a model of the CO remnant that
mimics the results of the SPH simulation using a one-dimensional hydrodynamic
stellar evolution code and then follow its secular evolution. The stellar
evolution models indicate that the growth of the cold core is controlled by
neutrino cooling at the interface between the core and the hot envelope, and
that carbon ignition in the envelope can be avoided despite high effective
accretion rates. This result suggests that the assumption of forced accretion
of cold matter that was adopted in previous studies of the evolution of double
CO white dwarf merger remnants may not be appropriate. Our results imply that
at least some products of double CO white dwarfs merger may be considered good
candidates for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. In this case, the
characteristic time delay between the initial dynamical merger and the eventual
explosion would be ~10^5 yr. (Abridged).

non-linearity of spacetime and we provide a physical interpretation for it. By
mapping this correction to the gravito-electro-magnetic framework, we study the
corrections that this new term introduces to the acceleration of point

their protoplanetary disks, but the extent to which material can flow from the
circumbinary disk across the gap onto the individual circumstellar disks has
been unclear. In binaries with eccentric orbits, periodic perturbation of the
outer disk is predicted to induce mass flow across the gap, resulting in
accretion that varies with the binary period. This accretion may manifest
itself observationally as periodic changes in luminosity. Here we present a
search for such periodic accretion in the pre-main-sequence spectroscopic
binary UZ Tau E. We present BVRI photometry spanning three years; we find that
the brightness of UZ Tau E is clearly periodic, with a best-fit period of 19.16
+/- 0.04 days. This is consistent with the spectroscopic binary period of 19.13
days, refined here from analysis of new and existing radial velocity data. The
brightness of UZ Tau E shows significant random variability, but the overall
periodic pattern is a broad peak in enhanced brightness, spanning more than
half the binary orbital period. The variability of the H-alpha line is not as
clearly periodic, but given the sparseness of the data, some periodic component
is not ruled out. The photometric variations are in good agreement with
predictions from simulations of binaries with orbital parameters similar to
those of UZ Tau E, suggesting that periodic accretion does occur from
circumbinary disks, replenishing the inner disks and possibly extending the
timescale over which they might form planets.

has uncovered their complex multi-mechanism-governed evolution processes.
Therefore, a better understanding of the structure and evolution of these
networked complex systems requires us to describe such processes in a more
detailed and realistic manner. In this paper, we introduce a new type of
network growth rule which comprises addition and deletion of nodes, and propose
an evolving network model to investigate the effect of node deleting on network
structure. It is found that, with the introduction of node deleting, network
structure is significantly transformed. In particular, degree distribution of
the network undergoes a transition from scale-free to exponential forms as the
intensity of node deleting increases. At the same time, nontrivial
disassortative degree correlation develops spontaneously as a natural result of
network evolution in the model. We also demonstrate that node deleting
introduced in the model does not destroy the connectedness of a growing network
so long as the increasing rate of edges is not excessively small. In addition,
it is found that node deleting will weaken but not eliminate the small-world
effect of a growing network, and generally it will decrease the clustering
coefficient in a network.

moment direction of the nanotube tip. This results in a signal which is
proportional to the absolute value of the signal normally observed in MFM. Our
modeling indicates that a significant fraction of the tip volume is involved in
the observed switching, and that it should be possible to image very high bit
densities with nanotube magnetic force sensors.

straightforward to estimate accurate black hole masses in early- and late-type

with a Schechter function and find, at the low-mass end, a logarithmic slope
(1+alpha) of ~0.7 for the full galaxy sample and ~1.0 for the early-type galaxy
sample. Considering spheroidal stellar systems brighter than M_B = -18 mag, and
integrating down to black hole masses of 10^6 M_sun, we find that the local
mass density of supermassive black holes in early-type galaxies rho_{bh,
early-type} = (3.5+/-1.2) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}, and in late-type
galaxies rho_{bh, late-type} = (1.0+/-0.5) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}. The
uncertainties are derived from Monte Carlo simulations which include
uncertainties in the M_bh-n relation, the catalogue of Sersic indices, the

black hole mass density is thus Omega_{bh, total} = (3.2+/-1.2) x 10^{-6} h_70.

suitable non-linear field transformations. For both of these cases the effect

previous calculations for the case of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM). Closed

To address the issue, we have substituted Ti at the Ru-sites in SrRuO3, where
SrRuO3 is a ferromagnetic material. Calculated results establish Ti4+ valence
states (similar to SrTiO3), which was predicted experimentally. Thus, Ti
substitution dilutes the Ru-O-Ru connectivity, which is manifested in the
calculated results in the form of significant band narrowing leading to finite
gap between t2g and eg bands. At 75% substitution, a large gap (> 2 eV) appears
at the Fermi level, e_F in the up spin density of states, while the down spin
states contributes at e_F characterizing the system a half-metallic
ferromagnet. The t2g - eg gap can be tailored judiciously by tuning Ti
concentrations to minimize thermal effects, which is often the major bottleneck
to achieve high spin polarization at elevated temperatures in other materials.
This study, thus, provides a novel but simple way to fabricate half-metallicity
in ferromagnetic materials, which are potential candidates for spin-based

experiments were conducted with the same device in order to determine the
evolution of the friction coefficient as a function of the applied pressure for
the different lubricant formulations. For the MoDTC film, the applied pressure
in the friction test remains low (<0.5 GPa) and the apparent friction
coefficient is high ($\mu$ > 0.4). For the tribofilms containing MoDTC together
with ZDTP, which permits the applied pressure to increase up to a few GPa
through some accommodation process, a very low friction domain appears (0.01 <
$\mu$ < 0.05), located a few nanometers below the surface of the tribofilm.
This low friction coefficient is attributed to the presence of MoS2 planes
sliding over each other in a favourable configuration obtained when the
pressure is sufficiently high, which is made possible by the presence of ZDTP.

0704.0339,"Lattice Boltzmann inverse kinetic approach for the incompressible
  Navier-Stokes equations",,,,,"['physics.flu-dyn', 'physics.comp-ph']",,"  In spite of the large number of papers appeared in the past which are devoted
to the lattice Boltzmann (LB) methods, basic aspects of the theory still remain
unchallenged. An unsolved theoretical issue is related to the construction of a
discrete kinetic theory which yields \textit{exactly} the fluid equations,
i.e., is non-asymptotic (here denoted as \textit{LB inverse kinetic theory}).
The purpose of this paper is theoretical and aims at developing an inverse
kinetic approach of this type. In principle infinite solutions exist to this
problem but the freedom can be exploited in order to meet important
requirements. In particular, the discrete kinetic theory can be defined so that
it yields exactly the fluid equation also for arbitrary non-equilibrium (but
suitably smooth) kinetic distribution functions and arbitrarily close to the
boundary of the fluid domain. Unlike previous entropic LB methods the theorem
can be obtained without functional constraints on the class of the initial
distribution functions. Possible realizations of the theory and asymptotic
approximations are provided which permit to determine the fluid equations
\textit{with prescribed accuracy.} As a result, asymptotic accuracy estimates
of customary LB approaches and comparisons with the Chorin artificial
compressibility method are discussed.

in a surface-induced potential. We present a general master equation governing
the dynamics of the translational states of the atom. In the framework of the
Debye model, we derive compact expressions for the rates for both upward and
downward transitions. Numerical calculations for the transition rates are
performed for a deep silica-induced potential allowing for a large number of
bound levels as well as free states of a cesium atom. The total absorption rate
is shown to be determined mainly by the bound-to-bound transitions for deep
bound levels and by bound-to-free transitions for shallow bound levels.
Moreover, the phonon emission and absorption processes can be orders of
magnitude larger for deep bound levels as compared to the shallow bound ones.
We also study various types of transitions from free states. We show that, for
thermal atomic cesium with temperature in the range from 100 $\mu$K to 400
$\mu$K in the vicinity of a silica surface with temperature of 300 K, the
adsorption (free-to-bound decay) rate is about two times larger than the
heating (free-to-free upward decay) rate, while the cooling (free-to-free
downward decay) rate is negligible.

asteroids and commonly attributed to the intervalence charge transfer
transition in oxidized iron. Our sample comprises fainter and smaller Trojans
as compared to the literature's data and allows us to investigate the
properties of objects with estimated diameter smaller than 40--50 km. The

that the blue and red objects have indistinguishable size distribution. We

Trojans at lower inclination appear significantly bluer than those at higher

both scalar and vector potentials are spherical, these conditions for

undertaken to date, trigonometric parallaxes are crucial missing data. Distance
measurements are mandatory to kinematically segregate halo object from disk
objects and hence enable a more reliable estimate of the local density of halo
dark matter residing in such objects.
  We present trigonometric parallax measurements for 15 candidate halo white
dwarfs (WDs) selected from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list. We observed the
stars using the ESO 1.56-m Danish Telescope and ESO 2.2-m telescope from August
2001 to July 2004. Parallaxes with accuracies of 1--2 mas were determined
yielding relative errors on distances of $\sim5$% for 6 objects, $\sim12$% for
3 objects, and $\sim20$% for two more objects. Four stars appear to be too
distant (probably farther than 100 pc) to have measurable parallaxes in our
observations. Distances, absolute magnitudes and revised space velocities were
derived for the 15 halo WDs from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list. Halo
membership is confirmed unambiguously for 6 objects while 5 objects may be
thick disk members and 4 objects are too distant to draw any conclusion based
solely on kinematics. Comparing our trigonometric parallaxes with photometric
parallaxes used in previous work reveals an overestimation of distance as

high degree of differential rotation are dynamically unstable against bar-mode

for gravitational wave astronomy in high-frequency sources such as core
collapse supernovae. In this paper we present high-resolution simulations,
performed with an adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamics code, of such low
T/|W| bar-mode instability. The complex morphological features involved in the
nonlinear dynamics of the instability are revealed in our simulations, which
show that the excitation of Kelvin-Helmholtz-like fluid modes outside the
corotation radius of the star leads to the saturation of the bar-mode
deformation. While the overall trends reported in an earlier investigation are
confirmed by our work, we also find that numerical resolution plays an
important role during the long-term, nonlinear behaviour of the instability,
which has implications on the dynamics of rotating stars and on the attainable

networks of interaction, such as model social networks, have been shown to have
a fundamental effect on the dynamics and outcome of evolutionary games. These
effects have, however, proved to be sensitive to the details of the underlying
topology and dynamics. Here we introduce a minimal population structure that is
described by two distinct hierarchical levels of interaction. We believe this
model is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend on
the details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution of
a system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processes
through two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of population
structure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: the
effective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of local
dynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of a
continuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populations
with hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratio
becomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatial
structure to the repeated prisoner's dilemma we uncover a novel and
counterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustains
cooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoner's
dilemma and also of the ""rock-paper-scissor"" game we find indications of rich
structure and are able to reproduce several effects observed in other models

the emergence of global oscillations.

and wave profiles of torsional Alfven oscillations in solar coronal loops.
Dispersion relations for torsional oscillations are derived analytically in
limits of weak and strong inhomogeneities. These analytical results are
verified by numerical solutions, which are valid for a wide range of
inhomogeneity strength. It is shown that the inhomogeneous mass density field
leads to the reduction of a wave frequency of torsional oscillations, in
comparison to that of estimated from mass density at the loop apex. This
frequency reduction results from the decrease of an average Alfven speed as far
as the inhomogeneous loop is denser at its footpoints. The derived dispersion
relations and wave profiles are important for potential observations of
torsional oscillations which result in periodic variations of spectral line
widths. Torsional oscillations offer an additional powerful tool for a

present and study a family of rate-1/2 partially systematic PCCCs, which we

analysis using the OPERA detector as a reference (our analysis can be upgraded
including a detailed simulation of the ICARUS detector). We point out that the
channel with the largest potential to constrain the sterile neutrino parameter
space at the CNGS beam is $\nu_\mu \to \nu_\tau$. The reason for that is
twofold: first, the active-sterile mixing angle that governs this oscillation
is the less constrained by present experiments; second, this is the signal for
which both OPERA and ICARUS have been designed, and thus benefits from an
extremely low background. In our analysis we also took into account $\nu_\mu
\to \nu_e$ oscillations. We find that the CNGS potential to look for sterile
neutrinos is limited with nominal intensity of the beam, but it is
significantly enhanced with a factor 2 to 10 increase in the neutrino flux.
Data from both channels allow us, in this case, to constrain further the
four-neutrino model parameter space. Our results hold for any value of
$\Dmq_\Sbl \gtrsim 0.1 \eVq$, \textit{i.e.} when oscillations driven by this
mass-squared difference are averaged. We have also checked that the bound on

around a body with an axisymmetric mass quadrupole moment Q to linear order in
Q, to the leading post-Newtonian order, and to linear order in the mass ratio.
This system admits three constants of the motion in absence of radiation
reaction: energy, angular momentum, and a third constant analogous to the
Carter constant. We compute instantaneous and time-averaged rates of change of
these three constants. For a point particle orbiting a black hole, Ryan has
computed the leading order evolution of the orbit's Carter constant, which is
linear in the spin. Our result, when combined with an interaction quadratic in
the spin (the coupling of the black hole's spin to its own radiation reaction
field), gives the next to leading order evolution. The effect of the
quadrupole, like that of the linear spin term, is to circularize eccentric
orbits and to drive the orbital plane towards antialignment with the symmetry
axis. In addition we consider a system of two point masses where one body has a
single mass multipole or current multipole. To linear order in the mass ratio,
to linear order in the multipole, and to the leading post-Newtonian order, we
show that there does not exist an analog of the Carter constant for such a
system (except for the cases of spin and mass quadrupole). With mild additional
assumptions, this result falsifies the conjecture that all vacuum, axisymmetric
spacetimes posess a third constant of geodesic motion.

functional properties of brain networks. Structural properties of networks
recently described allow their characterization as small-world, random
(exponential) and scale-free. They complement the set of other properties that
have been explored in the context of brain connectivity, such as topology,
hodology, clustering, and hierarchical organization. Here we apply new network
analysis methods to cortical inter-areal connectivity networks for the cat and
macaque brains. We compare these corticocortical fibre networks to benchmark
rewired, small-world, scale-free and random networks, using two analysis
strategies, in which we measure the effects of the removal of nodes and
connections on the structural properties of the cortical networks. The brain
networks' structural decay is in most respects similar to that of scale-free
networks. The results implicate highly connected hub-nodes and bottleneck
connections as structural basis for some of the conditional robustness of brain
systems. This informs the understanding of the development of brain networks'

because of their role as heavy traffic approximations for some stochastic

SRBMs is proved. This provides sufficient conditions for a process that
satisfies the definition of an SRBM, except for small random perturbations in
the defining conditions, to be close in distribution to an SRBM. A crucial
ingredient in the proof of this result is an oscillation inequality for
solutions of a perturbed Skorokhod problem. We use the invariance principle to
show weak existence of SRBMs under mild conditions. We also use the invariance
principle, in conjunction with known uniqueness results for SRBMs, to give some
sufficient conditions for validating approximations involving (i) SRBMs in
convex polyhedrons with a constant reflection vector field on each face of the

collisions of the two extreme orientations can achieve full stopping, and also
form a bulk of hot, dense nuclear matter with a sufficiently large volume and
long duration, due to the largely deformed uranium nuclei. The nucleon sideward
flow in the tip-tip collisions is nearly 3 times larger than that in body-body
ones at normalized impact parameter $b/b_{max}<0.5$, and that the body-body
central collisions have a largest negative nucleon elliptic flow $v_{2}=-12%$

By coupling them to an electromagnetic field and expanding the square root (and
taking into account terms of quadratic order in the electromagnetic coupling
constant e), it is possible to calculate scattering matrix elements within the
framework of quantum electrodynamics, e.g. like those for Compton scattering or
for the scattering of two identical particles. This will be done here for the

accompanied by the growth of a H- photodissociating flux. We estimate the
impact of this flux on the formation of molecular hydrogen and cooling in the
first galaxies, assuming different types of radiation sources (e.g. Pop II and
Pop III stars, miniquasars). We find that H- photodissociation reduces the
formation of H2 molecules by a factor of ~1+1000k_s*x/(f_esc*delta), where x is
the mean ionized fraction in the IGM, f_esc is the fraction of ionizing photons
that escape from their progenitor halos, delta is the local gas overdensity and
k_s is an order unity constant which depends on the type of radiation source.
By the time a significant fraction of the universe becomes ionized, H-
photodissociation may significantly reduce the H2 abundance and, with it, the
primordial star formation rate, delaying the progress of reionization.

${\dot M}=10^{-6} M_\sun yr^{-1}$). CB54 harbors another near-infrared source
(CB54YC1-I), which was not detected by our observations. The non-detection is
consistent with CB54YC1-I being a highly extinguished embedded young A or B
star or a background G or F giant. An alternative explanation for CB54YC1-I is
that the source is an embedded protostar viewed at an extremely high
inclination angle, and the near-infrared detections are not of the central
protostar, but of light scattered by the accretion disk into our line of sight.
In addition, we have discovered three new mid-infrared sources, which are
spatially coincident with the previously known dense core in CB54. The source
temperatures ($\sim100$K) and association of the mid-infrared sources with the
dense core suggests that these mid-infrared objects may be embedded class 0

conditions are fulfilled, as for most known black hole/ring solutions. (The
conclusions change when the Killing generator becomes null, such as at Killing
horizons.) Next we demonstrate that the same Weyl types characterize warped
product spacetimes with a one-dimensional Lorentzian (timelike) factor, whereas
warped spacetimes with a two-dimensional Lorentzian factor are restricted to
the types D or O. By exploring the Bianchi identities, we then analyze the
simplest non-trivial case from the above classes - type D vacuum spacetimes,
possibly with a cosmological constant, dropping, however, the assumptions that
the spacetime is static, stationary or warped. It is shown that for ``generic''
type D vacuum spacetimes the corresponding principal null directions are
geodetic in any dimension (this applies also to type II spacetimes). For n>=5,
however, there may exist particular cases of type D spacetimes which admit
non-geodetic multiple principal null directions and we present such examples in
any n>=7. Further studies are restricted to five dimensions, where the type D
Weyl tensor is described by a 3x3 matrix \Phi_{ij}. In the case with
``twistfree'' (A_{ij}=0) principal null geodesics we show that in a ``generic''
case \Phi_{ij} is symmetric and eigenvectors of \Phi_{ij} coincide with those
of the expansion matrix S_{ij}, providing us with three preferred spacelike
directions of the spacetime. Similar results are also obtained when relaxing
the twistfree condition and assuming instead that \Phi_{ij} is symmetric. The

spectroscopic analysis yields a spectral type of G1-1.5V and an age of about
100 Myrs. Variations in stellar radial velocity of HD 70573 have been monitored
since December 2003 until January 2007. The velocity accuracy of FEROS within
this period is about 10 m/s. HD 70573 shows a radial velocity variation with a
period of 852 +/- 12 days and a semi-amplitude of 149 +/- 6 m/s. The period of
this variation is significantly longer than its rotational period, which is 3.3
days. Based on the analysis of the Ca II K emission line, Halpha and Teff
variation as stellar activity indicators as well as the lack of a correlation
between the bisector velocity span and the radial velocity, we can exclude the
rotational modulation and non-radial pulsations as the source of the
long-period radial velocity variation. Thus, the presence of a low-mass
companion around the star provides the best explanation for the observed radial
velocity variation. Assuming a primary mass m1=1.0 +/- 0.1 Msun for the host
star, we calculated a minimum mass of the companion m2sini of 6.1 Mjup, which
lies in the planetary mass regime, and an orbital semi-major axis of 1.76 AU.
The orbit of the planet has an eccentricity of e=0.4. The planet discovery

we described how to use the tools of geometrical engineering to deform
geometrically-engineered grand unified models into ones with lower symmetry.
This top-down unfolding has the advantage that the relative positions of
singularities giving rise to the many `low energy' matter fields are related by
only a few parameters which deform the geometry of the unified model. And
because the relative positions of singularities are necessary to compute the
superpotential, for example, this is a framework in which the arbitrariness of
geometrically engineered models can be greatly reduced.
  In our earlier paper, this picture was made concrete for the case of
deforming the representations of an SU(5) model into their Standard Model
content. In this paper we continue that discussion to show how a geometrically
engineered 16 of SO(10) can be unfolded into the Standard Model, and how the
three families of the Standard Model uniquely emerge from the unfolding of a
single, isolated E8 singularity.

tight orbits around their host stars. Due to the difficulties of forming these
`hot Jupiters' in situ, they are generally assumed to have migrated to their
present orbits through interactions with their nascent discs. In this paper, we
present a systematic study of giant planet migration in power law discs. We
find that the planetary migration rate is proportional to the disc surface
density. This is inconsistent with the assumption that the migration rate is
simply the viscous drift speed of the disc. However, this result can be
obtained by balancing the angular momentum of the planet with the viscous
torque in the disc. We have verified that this result is not affected by
adjusting the resolution of the grid, the smoothing length used, or the time at
which the planet is released to migrate.

The lines are associated with highly ionized Ne, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, and Fe,

however, we discovered dramatic variability of the lines over the duration of
the present observation. For instance, the flux of the Ne X line at 12.14 \AA\
was about $5 \times 10^{-3}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the early part of
the observation but became subsequently undetectable, with a 99% upper limit of
$0.06 \times 10^{-3}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ on the flux of the line. This
implies that the line weakened by nearly two orders of magnitude on a timescale

generally attributed to the absorption of X-rays by ionized stellar wind in the

sensitivity of a ground-based microlensing survey is limited to the vicinity of

probabilistic grounds for any individual candidate system in this separation
range. Analysis of the association's two-point correlation function shows that
there is a significant probability (25%) that at least one pair of low-mass

use these data in combination with published data to probe the large-scale
structure of the Milky Way's magnetic field. We show that the magnitudes of
these RMs oscillate with longitude in a manner that correlates with the
locations of the Galactic spiral arms. The observed pattern in RMs requries the
presence of at least one large-scale magnetic reversal in the fourth Galactic
quadrant, located between the Sagittarius- Carina and Scutum-Crux spiral arms.
To quantitatively compare our measurements to other recent studies, we consider
all available extragalactic and pulsar RMs in the region we have surveyed, and
jointly fit these data to simple models in which the large-scale field follows
the spiral arms. In the best-fitting model, the magnetic field in the fourth
Galactic quadrant is directed clockwise in the Sagittarius-Carina spiral arm
(as viewed from the North Galactic pole), but is oriented counter- clockwise in
the Scutum-Crux arm. This contrasts with recent analyses of pulsar RMs alone,
in which the fourth-quadrant field was presumed to be directed
counter-clockwise in the Sagittarius- Carina arm. Also in contrast to recent
pulsar RM studies, our joint modeling of pulsar and extragalactic RMs
demonstrates that large numbers of large-scale magnetic field reversals are not
required to account for observations.

the TWA 7 disk (d=55 pc) an order of magnitude more massive than the disk
reported around AU Microscopii (GL 803), the closest (9.9 pc) debris disk
detected around an M dwarf. This is consistent with TWA 7 being slightly

dust is at a single radius from the star, with a range of temperatures
according to grain size, is as effective at fitting the emission spectrum as a

work mainly on two XMM-Newton observations of GX 339-4, because they provided
high-quality data at low energies (below 1 keV) which are critical for reliably
modeling the spectrum of the accretion disk. A key issue examined is the
determination of the so-called ""color correction factor"", which is often
empirically introduced to account for the deviation of the local disk spectrum
from a blackbody (due to electron scattering). This factor cannot be
pre-determined theoretically because it may vary with, e.g., mass accretion
rate, among a number of important factors. We follow up on an earlier
suggestion to estimate the color correction observationally by modeling the
disk spectrum with saturated Compton scattering. We show that the spectra can
be fitted well and the approach yields reasonable values for the color
correction factor. For comparison, we have also attempted to fit the spectra

bipartite subgraph whose sum of edge weights is maximized. This problem has
various applications in bioinformatics, machine learning and databases and its
(in)approximability remains open. In this paper, we show that for a wide range
of choices of $\mathcal{S}$, specifically when $| \frac{\min\mathcal{S}} {\max
\mathcal{S}} | \in \Omega(\eta^{\delta-1/2}) \cap O(\eta^{1/2-\delta})$ (where
$\eta = \max\{|V_1|, |V_2|\}$, and $\delta \in (0,1/2]$), no polynomial time
algorithm can approximate $\mathcal{S}$-MWEB within a factor of $n^{\epsilon}$
for some $\epsilon > 0$ unless $\mathsf{RP = NP}$. This hardness result gives
justification of the heuristic approaches adopted for various applied problems
in the aforementioned areas, and indicates that good approximation algorithms
are unlikely to exist. Specifically, we give two applications by showing that:
1) finding statistically significant biclusters in the SAMBA model, proposed in
\cite{Tan02} for the analysis of microarray data, is
$n^{\epsilon}$-inapproximable; and 2) no polynomial time algorithm exists for
the Minimum Description Length with Holes problem \cite{Bu05} unless
$\mathsf{RP=NP}$.

well with both thermal and non-thermal models, its spatial distribution is

extended HB are clearly distinct from other normal GCs in kinematics and mass.
The GCs with extended HB are more massive than normal GCs, and are dominated by
random motion with no correlation between kinematics and metallicity.
Surprisingly, however, when they are excluded, most normal GCs in the inner
halo show clear signs of dissipational collapse that apparently led to the
formation of the disk. Normal GCs in the outer halo share their kinematic
properties with the extended HB GCs, which is consistent with the accretion
origin. Our result further suggests heterogeneous origins of GCs, and we
anticipate this to be a starting point for more detailed investigations of

of a normal phase, acting as pinning centers. A prototype of such a structure
is YBCO film, containing clusters of columnar defects, as well as the BSCCO/Ag
sheathed tape, which is of practical interest for wire fabrication. Transition
of the superconductor into a resistive state corresponds to the percolation
transition from a pinned vortex state to a resistive state when the vortices
are free to move. The dependencies of the free vortex density on the fractal
dimension of the cluster boundary as well as the resistance on the transport
current are obtained. It is revealed that a mixed state of the vortex glass
type is realized in the superconducting system involved. The current-voltage
characteristics of superconductors containing fractal clusters are obtained and
their features are studied.

heavy nuclei, like the charge and the shape, are studied in the Time-Dependent
Hartree-Fock theory. The pre-equilibrium Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) is used
to probe the fusion path. It is shown that such isovector collective state is
excited in N/Z asymmetric fusion and to a less extent in mass asymmetric
systems. The characteristics of this GDR are governed by the structure of the
fused system in its preequilibrium phase, like its deformation, rotation and
vibration. In particular, we show that a lowering of the pre-equilibrium GDR
energy is expected as compared to the statistical one. Revisiting experimental
data, we extract an evidence of this lowering for the first time. We also
quantify the fusion-evaporation enhancement due to gamma-ray emission from the
pre-equilibrium GDR. This cooling mechanism along the fusion path may be
suitable to synthesize in the future super heavy elements using radioactive
beams with strong N/Z asymmetries in the entrance channel.

problem, i.e., determining an ordered set of nodes to relay the data from the
source to the destination. We find that for a given route, the
decode-and-forward strategy, which is an information theoretic cooperative
coding strategy, achieves rates significantly higher than that achievable by
the usual multi-hop coding strategy, which is a point-to-point non-cooperative
coding strategy. We construct an algorithm to find an optimal route (in terms
of rate maximizing) for the decode-and-forward strategy. Since the algorithm
runs in factorial time in the worst case, we propose a heuristic algorithm that
runs in polynomial time. The heuristic algorithm outputs an optimal route when
the nodes transmit independent codewords. We implement these coding strategies

coexistence of a predator-prey system. The individuals of each species are
localized over the sites of a lattice and the local stochastic updating rules
are inspired on the processes of the Lotka-Volterra model. Two levels of
mean-field approximations are set up. The simple approximation is equivalent to
an extended patch model, a simple metapopulation model with patches colonized
by prey, patches colonized by predators and empty patches. This approximation
is capable of describing the limited available space for species occupancy. The
pair approximation is moreover able to describe two types of coexistence of
prey and predators: one where population densities are constant in time and
another displaying self-sustained time-oscillations of the population
densities. The oscillations are associated with limit cycles and arise through
a Hopf bifurcation. They are stable against changes in the initial conditions
and, in this sense, they differ from the Lotka-Volterra cycles which depend on
initial conditions. In this respect, the present model is biologically more
realistic than the Lotka-Volterra model.

Evolutionary theory predicts that IPs with long orbital periods evolve through
the 2-3 hour period gap, but it is very uncertain what the properties of the
resulting objects are. Whilst a relatively large number of long-period IPs are
known, very few of these have short orbital periods. We present phase-resolved
spectroscopy and photometry of SDSS J233325.92+152222.1 and classify it as the
IP with the shortest known orbital period (83.12 +/- 0.09 min), which contains
a white dwarf with a relatively long spin period (41.66 +/- 0.13 min). We
estimate the white dwarf's magnetic moment to be mu(WD) \approx 2 x 10^33 G
cm^3, which is not only similar to three of the other four confirmed
short-period IPs but also to those of many of the long-period IPs. We suggest
that long-period IPs conserve their magnetic moment as they evolve towards
shorter orbital periods. Therefore the dominant population of long-period IPs,
which have white dwarf spin periods roughly ten times shorter than their
orbital periods, will likely end up as short-period IPs like SDSS J2333, with
spin periods a large fraction of their orbital periods.

hot molecular core into six submm continuum sources with the finest spatial
resolution of 0.36''x0.25'' (~1800AU) achieved so far. Four of them located
within 7800(AU)^2 comprise a proto-Trapezium system with estimated protostellar
densities of 1.4x0^5 protostars/pc^3. The plethora of ~80 spectral lines allows
us to study the molecular outflow(s), the core kinematics, the temperature
structure of the region as well as chemical effects. The derived hot core
temperatures are of the order 300K. We find interesting chemical spatial
differentiations, e.g., C34S is deficient toward the hot core and is enhanced
at the UCHII/hot core interface, which may be explained by temperature
sensitive desorption from grains and following gas phase chemistry. The
SiO(8-7) emission outlines likely two molecular outflows emanating from this
hot core region. Emission from most other molecules peaks centrally on the hot
core and is not dominated by any individual submm peak. Potential reasons for
that are discussed. A few spectral lines that are associated with the main
submm continuum source, show a velocity gradient perpendicular to the
large-scale outflow. Since this velocity structure comprises three of the
central protostellar sources, this is not a Keplerian disk. While the data are
consistent with a gas core that may rotate and/or collapse, we cannot exclude
the outflow(s) and/or nearby expanding UCHII region as possible alternative
causes of this velocity pattern.

Static fractional charges are confined by a weak linear force, most probably

one-to-many throughput capacity) of IEEE 802.11 multi-hop networks. It has
generally been assumed in prior studies that the many-to-one throughput
capacity is upper-bounded by the link capacity L. Throughput capacity L is not
achievable under 802.11. This paper introduces the notion of ""canonical
networks"", which is a class of regularly-structured networks whose capacities
can be analyzed more easily than unstructured networks. We show that the
throughput capacity of canonical networks under 802.11 has an analytical upper
bound of 3L/4 when the source nodes are two or more hops away from the sink;
and simulated throughputs of 0.690L (0.740L) when the source nodes are many
hops away. We conjecture that 3L/4 is also the upper bound for general
networks. When all links have equal length, 2L/3 can be shown to be the upper
bound for general networks. Our simulations show that 802.11 networks with
random topologies operated with AODV routing can only achieve throughputs far
below the upper bounds. Fortunately, by properly selecting routes near the
gateway (or by properly positioning the relay nodes leading to the gateway) to
fashion after the structure of canonical networks, the throughput can be
improved significantly by more than 150%. Indeed, in a dense network, it is
worthwhile to deactivate some of the relay nodes near the sink judiciously.

simulation is used to investigate the diffusion dynamics in Al80Ni20 melts.
Experimentally, the self-diffusion coefficient of Ni is measured by the

method yields also the interdiffusion coefficient. Whereas the experiments were
done in the normal liquid state, the simulations provided the determination of
both self-diffusion and interdiffusion constants in the undercooled regime as
well. The simulation results show good agreement with the experimental data. In
the temperature range 3000 K >= T >= 715 K, the interdiffusion coefficient is
larger than the self-diffusion constants. Furthermore the simulation shows that
this difference becomes larger in the undercooled regime. This result can be
refered to a relatively strong temperature dependence of the thermodynamic
factor \Phi, which describes the thermodynamic driving force for
interdiffusion. The simulations also indicate that the Darken equation is a
good approximation, even in the undercooled regime. This implies that dynamic
cross correlations play a minor role for the temperature range under
consideration.

globular cluster system color distributions. Understanding the mechanisms which
lead to multiple globular cluster sub-populations is essential for a complete
picture of massive galaxy formation. By assuming that globular cluster
formation traces the total star formation and taking into account the radial
variations in the composite stellar populations predicted by the Pipino &
Matteucci (2004) multi-zone photo-chemical evolution code, we compute the
distribution of globular cluster properties as a function of galactocentric
radius. We compare our results to the spectroscopic measurements of globular
clusters in nearby early-type galaxies by Puzia et al. (2006) and show that the
observed multi-modality in globular cluster systems of massive ellipticals can
be, at least partly, ascribed to the radial variation in the mix of stellar
populations. Our model predicts the presence of a super-metal-rich population
of globular clusters in the most massive elliptical galaxies, which is in very
good agreement with the spectroscopic observations. Furthermore, we investigate
the impact of other non-linear mechanisms that shape the metallicity
distribution of globular cluster systems, in particular the role of
merger-induced globular cluster formation and a non-linear color-metallicity
transformation, and discuss their influence in the context of our model

Binaries, the Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs). Archival INTEGRAL data
and RXTE observations showed that the outbursts occur with a periodicity of
~330 days. Thus, IGR J11215-5952 is the first SFXT displaying periodic
outbursts, possibly related to the orbital period. We performed a Target of
Opportunity observation with Swift with the main aim of monitoring the source
behaviour around the time of the fifth outburst, expected on 2007 Feb 9. The
source field was observed with Swift twice a day (2ks/day) starting from 4th
February, 2007, until the fifth outburst, and then for ~5 ks a day afterwards,
during a monitoring campaign that lasted 23 days for a total on-source exposure
of ~73 ks. This is the most complete monitoring campaign of an outburst from a
SFXT. The spectrum during the brightest flares is well described by an absorbed
power law with a photon index of 1 and N_H~1 10^22 cm^-2. A 1-10 keV peak
luminosity of ~10^36 erg s^-1 was derived (assuming 6.2 kpc, the distance of
the optical counterpart). These Swift observations are a unique data-set for an
outburst of a SFXT, thanks to the combination of sensitivity and time coverage,
and they allowed a study of IGR J11215-5952 from outburst onset to almost
quiescence. We find that the accretion phase lasts longer than previously
thought on the basis of lower sensitivity instruments observing only the
brightest flares. The observed phenomenology is consistent with a smoothly
increasing flux triggered at the periastron passage in a wide eccentric orbit
with many flares superimposed, possibly due to episodic or inhomogeneous
accretion.

the density of the ionized gas, in a sample of 41 Type 1 and Type 2 active
galactic nuclei (AGNs) observed with the Infrared Spectrograph on board
Spitzer. The majority of galaxies with both [NeV] lines detected have observed
[NeV] line flux ratios consistent with or below the theoretical low density
limit, based on calculations using currently available collision strengths and
ignoring absorption and stimulated emission. We find that Type 2 AGNs have
lower line flux ratios than Type 1 AGNs and that all of the galaxies with line
flux ratios below the low density limit are Type 2 AGNs. We argue that
differential infrared extinction to the [NeV] emitting region due to dust in
the obscuring torus is responsible for the ratios below the low density limit
and we suggest that the ratio may be a tracer of the inclination angle of the
torus to our line of sight. Because the temperature of the gas, the amount of
extinction, and the effect of absorption and stimulated emission on the line
ratios are all unknown, we are not able to determine the electron densities
associated with the [NeV] line flux ratios for the objects in our sample. We
also find that the [SIII] emission from the galaxies in our sample is extended
and originates primarily in star forming regions. Since the emission from
low-ionization species is extended, any analysis using line flux ratios from
such species obtained from slits of different sizes is invalid for most nearby

vector bosons caused by spontaneous Lorentz invariance violation (SLIV). To
this end, the SLIV which evolves in a general Yang-Mills type theory with the
nonlinear vector field constraint $Tr(% \boldsymbol{A}_{\mu
}\boldsymbol{A}^{\mu})=\pm M^{2}$ ($M$ is a proposed SLIV scale) imposed is
considered in detail. With an internal symmetry group $G$ having $D$ generators
not only the pure Lorentz symmetry SO(1,3), but the larger accidental symmetry
$SO(D,3D)$ of the SLIV constraint in itself appears to be spontaneously broken
as well. As a result, while the pure Lorentz violation still generates only one
genuine Goldstone vector boson, the accompanying pseudo-Goldstone vector bosons
related to the $SO(D,3D)$ breaking also come into play in the final arrangement
of the entire Goldstone vector field multiplet. Remarkably, they remain
strictly massless, being protected by gauge invariance of the Yang-Mills theory
involved. We show that, although this theory contains a plethora of Lorentz and
$CPT$ violating couplings, they do not lead to physical SLIV effects which turn
out to be strictly cancelled in all the lowest order processes considered.
However, the physical Lorentz violation could appear if the internal gauge
invariance were slightly broken at very small distances influenced by gravity.
For the SLIV scale comparable with the Planck one the Lorentz violation could
become directly observable at low energies.

cross sections on particle production is investigated in heavy ion collisions
($HIC$) at intermediate energies. In particular, using a fully covariant
relativistic transport approach, we see that the density dependence of the {\it
inelastic} cross sections appreciably affects the pion and kaon yields and
their rapidity distributions. However, the $(\pi^{-}/\pi^{+})$- and
$(K^{0}/K^{+})$-ratios depend only moderately on the in-medium behavior of the
inelastic cross sections. This is particularly true for kaon yield ratios,
since kaons are more uniformly produced in high density regions. Kaon
potentials are also suitably evaluated in two schemes, a chiral perturbative
approach and an effective meson-quark coupling method, with consistent results
showing a similar repulsive contribution for $K^{+}$ and $K^{0}$. As a
consequence we expect rather reduced effects on the yield ratios. We conclude
that particle ratios appear to be robust observables for probing the nuclear
equation of state ($EoS$) at high baryon density and, particularly, its
isovector sector.

expressed as conformal field theory (CFT) correlators, notably the Laughlin
wave function at filling factor $\nu=1/m$ ($m$ odd) and its quasiholes, and the
Pfaffian wave function at $\nu=1/2$ and its quasiholes. We develop a general
scheme for constructing composite-fermion (CF) wave functions from conformal
field theory. Quasiparticles at $\nu=1/m$ are created by inserting anyonic
vertex operators, $P_{\frac{1}{m}}(z)$, that replace a subset of the electron
operators in the correlator. The one-quasiparticle wave function is identical
to the corresponding CF wave function, and the two-quasiparticle wave function
has correct fractional charge and statistics and is numerically almost
identical to the corresponding CF wave function. We further show how to exactly
represent the CF wavefunctions in the Jain series $\nu = s/(2sp+1)$ as the CFT
correlators of a new type of fermionic vertex operators, $V_{p,n}(z)$,
constructed from $n$ free compactified bosons; these operators provide the CFT
representation of composite fermions carrying $2p$ flux quanta in the $n^{\rm
th}$ CF Landau level. We also construct the corresponding quasiparticle- and
quasihole operators and argue that they have the expected fractional charge and
statistics. For filling fractions 2/5 and 3/7 we show that the chiral CFTs that
describe the bulk wave functions are identical to those given by Wen's general
classification of quantum Hall states in terms of $K$-matrices and $l$- and
$t$-vectors, and we propose that to be generally true. Our results suggest a
general procedure for constructing quasiparticle wave functions for other
fractional Hall states, as well as for constructing ground states at filling

New expressions are derived for the different contributions to the noise budget
on transit time-scales and the least-squares detection statistic for box-shaped
transits, and their behaviour as a function of stellar mass is re-examined.
Correlated noise that is constant with apparent stellar magnitude implies a
steep decrease in detection probability at the high mass end which, when
considered jointly with the radial velocity requirements, can severely limit
the potential of otherwise promising surveys in star clusters. However, we find
that small-aperture, wide field surveys may detect hot Neptunes whose radial

spectral and temporal resolution observations obtained by IBIS. The full 3D
velocity vector field for the SG has been reconstructed at two different
photospheric heights. In order to strengthen our findings, we also computed the
mean radial flow of the SG by means of cork tracing. We also studied the
behaviour of the horizontal and Line of Sight plasma flow cospatial with
cluster of bright CaII structures of magnetic origin to better understand the
interaction between photospheric convection and small scale magnetic features.
The SG cell we investigated seems to be organized with an almost radial flow
from its centre to the border. The large scale divergence structure is probably
created by a compact region of constant up-flow close to the cell centre. On
the edge of the SG, isolated regions of strong convergent flow are nearby or
cospatial with extended clusters of bright CaII wing features forming the knots
of the magnetic network.

antiparallel chain-like patterns are frozen in at low temperatures, leading to

interfaces in the presence of a delta-pinning at height zero. There is a
detailed mathematical understanding of the depinning transition in 2 dimensions

measure stays bounded uniformly in the volume for any positive pinning force
and diverges like the logarithm of the pinning force when it tends to zero.
  How does the presence of a quenched disorder term in the Hamiltonian modify
this transition? We show that an arbitarily weak random field term is enough to
beat an arbitrarily strong delta-pinning in 2 dimensions and will cause
delocalization. The proof is based on a rigorous lower bound for the overlap
between local magnetizations and random fields in finite volume. In 2
dimensions it implies growth faster than the volume which is a contradiction to
localization. We also derive a simple complementary inequality which shows that
in higher dimensions the fraction of pinned sites converges to one when the
pinning force tends to infinity.

grains in SN ejecta, in accordance with current theoretical models. Yet,
observations of the few well studied SNe and SN remnants imply condensation
efficiencies which are about two orders of magnitude smaller. Motivated by this
tension, we have (i) revisited the model of Todini & Ferrara (2001) for dust
formation in the ejecta of core collapse SNe and (ii) followed, for the first
time, the evolution of newly condensed grains from the time of formation to
their survival - through the passage of the reverse shock - in the SN remnant.
We find that 0.1 - 0.6 M_sun of dust form in the ejecta of 12 - 40 M_sun
stellar progenitors. Depending on the density of the surrounding ISM, between
2-20% of the initial dust mass survives the passage of the reverse shock, on
time-scales of about 4-8 x 10^4 yr from the stellar explosion. Sputtering by
the hot gas induces a shift of the dust size distribution towards smaller
grains. The resulting dust extinction curve shows a good agreement with that
derived by observations of a reddened QSO at z =6.2. Stochastic heating of
small grains leads to a wide distribution of dust temperatures. This supports
the idea that large amounts (~ 0.1 M_sun) of cold dust (T ~ 40K) can be present
in SN remnants, without being in conflict with the observed IR emission.

leads to a universal scaling behavior for the dipole scattering amplitude. The
running coupling corrections calculated recently significantly change the shape
of the scaling function as compared to the fixed coupling case leading to a
considerable increase in the anomalous dimension and to a slow-down of the
evolution with rapidity. The difference between the two recent calculations is
due to an extra contribution to the evolution kernel, referred to as the
subtraction term, which arises when running coupling corrections are included.
These subtraction terms were neglected in both recent calculations. We evaluate
numerically the subtraction terms for both calculations, and demonstrate that
when the subtraction terms are added back to the evolution kernels obtained in
the two works the resulting dipole amplitudes agree with each other! We then
use the complete running coupling kernel including the subtraction term to find
the numerical solution of the resulting full non-linear evolution equation with
the running coupling corrections. Again the scaling regime is recovered at very

properties have been obtained comparing the observations with self-consistent
disk models for the dust and CO emission. The circumstellar disk is resolved
both in the continuum and in CO. We find strong evidence that the circumstellar
material is in Keplerian rotation around a central star of 2.6 Msun. The disk
inclination with respect to the line of sight is 46+-4 deg with a position
angle of 128+-4 deg. The slope of the dust opacity measured between 0.87 and 7
mm (beta=1) confirms the presence of mm/cm-size grains in the disk midplane.
The dust continuum emission is asymmetric and confined inside a radius of 200
AU while the CO emission extends up to 540 AU. The comparison between dust and
CO temperature indicates that CO is present only in the disk interior. Finally,
we obtain an increasing depletion of CO isotopomers from 12CO to 13CO and C18O.
We argue that these results support the idea that the disk of HD 163296 is
strongly evolved. In particular, we suggest that there is a strong depletion of
dust relative to gas outside 200 AU; this may be due to the inward migration of
large bodies that form in the outer disk or to clearing of a large gap in the
dust distribution by a low mass companion.

is more important in determining the shapes of the Stokes V profiles than the

in terms of the parameters tan_beta and the Higgs-boson mass scale, M_A. We
study the dependence of the 5 sigma discovery contours in the M_A-tan_beta
plane on variations of the other supersymmetric parameters. The largest effects
arise from a change in the higgsino mass parameter mu, which enters both via
higher-order radiative corrections and via the kinematics of Higgs decays into
supersymmetric particles. While the variation of $\mu$ can shift the
prospective discovery reach (and correspondingly the ``LHC wedge'' region) by
about Delta tan_beta = 10, we find that the discovery reach is rather stable
with respect to the impact of other supersymmetric parameters. Within the
discovery region we analyze the accuracy with which the masses of the heavy
neutral Higgs bosons can be determined. We find that an accuracy of 1-4% should
be achievable, which could make it possible in favourable regions of the MSSM
parameter space to experimentally resolve the signals of the two heavy MSSM

Some of the difference can be explained if the early post-AGB evolution is
faster than predicted by the Bl\""ocker tracks. Between 30 and 50 per cent of WD
may avoid the PN phase because of too low mass. However, the discrepancy cannot
be fully resolved and WD mass distributions may have been broadened by

significant deviations from the usual $t^{1/4}$ scaling of the terrace-width
correlation function occurs for a critical time $\tau$ which is dependent upon
the three energy scales in the problem: $k_{B}T$, the step stiffness, $\gamma$,
and the bias associated with adatom hopping under the influence of an
electromigration force, $\pm \Delta U$. For ($t < \tau$), the correlation
function evolves as a superposition of $t^{1/4}$ and $t^{3/4}$ power laws. For
$t \ge \tau$ a closed form expression can be derived. This behavior is
confirmed by a Monte-Carlo simulation using a discrete model of the step

define three local morphological measures, namely the signed-intensity,
orientation and elongation of local features. Detections of correlation between
the WMAP and NVSS data are made with each of these morphological measures. The
most significant detection is obtained in the correlation of the
signed-intensity of local features at a significance of 99.9%. By inspecting
signed-intensity sky maps, it is possible for the first time to see the

instrumental systematics in the WMAP data are ruled out as the source of all

0704.0632,Detecting and Characterizing Planetary Systems with Transit Timing,"7 pages, 2 figures, white paper submitted to the Exoplanet Task Force",,,,['astro-ph'],,"  In the coming decades, research in extrasolar planets aims to advance two
goals: 1) detecting and characterizing low-mass planets increasingly similar to
the Earth, and 2) improving our understanding of planet formation. We present a
new planet detection method that is capable of making large advances towards
both of these objectives and describe a modest network of telescopes that is
able to make the requisite observations. In a system where a known planet
transits its host star, a second planet in that system will cause the time
between transits to vary. These transit timing variations can be used to infer
the orbital elements and mass of the perturbing planet even if it has a mass
that is smaller than the mass of the Earth. This detection technique
complements other techniques because it is most sensitive in mean-motion
resonances where, due to degeneracies, other techniques have reduced
sensitivity. Small ground-based observatories have already exceeded the
photometric precision necessary to detect sub-Earth mass planets. However, TTV
planet searches are currently limited by the relatively small number of
high-precision transit data and insufficient observing time on existing
telescopes. These issues will be compounded as the number of known transiting
planets suitable for TTV study will increase substantially in the near future.
A relatively modest investment in a ground-based network of small ($\sim 0.5
{\rm m}$ telescopes could provide the needed coverage and so dramatically
increase the effectiveness of transit timing observations.

synthetic loops and we place them on real backgrounds from data obtained with
the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (\textit{TRACE}). We apply to these

us to distinguish constant width loops from loops that expand appreciably with
height, as predicted by simple force-free field models. This holds even for
loops near the resolution limit. The procedure can easily determine when loops
are below resolution limit and therefore not reliably measured. We find that
small-scale variations in the measured loop width are likely due to
imperfections in the background subtraction. The greatest errors occur in
especially narrow loops and in places where the background is especially bright
relative to the loop. We stress, however, that these effects do not impact the
ability to measure large-scale variations. The result that observed loops do
not expand systematically with height is robust.

that in most of the models based on the KKLT construction, the value of the

the gravitino mass in the usual range, m_{3/2} < O(1) TeV, this leads to an

behavioral response has been proposed. A neural circuit can be thought of as a
directed multigraph whose each vertex is a neuron and each edge is a synapse.
It has been assumed in this paper that the behavior of such circuits is
manifested through the collective behavior of neurons belonging to that
circuit. Behavioral information of each neuron is contained in the coefficients
of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) over the output spike train. Those
coefficients form a vector in a multidimensional vector space. Behavioral
dynamics of a neuronal network in response to strong aversive stimuli has been
studied in a vector space in which a suitable pseudometric has been defined.
The neurodynamical model of network behavior has been formulated in terms of
existing memory, synaptic plasticity and feelings. The model has an analogy in
classical electrostatics, by which the notion of force and potential energy has
been introduced. Since the model takes input from each neuron in a network and
produces a behavior as the output, it would be extremely difficult or may even
be impossible to implement. But with the help of the model a possible
explanation for an hitherto unexplained neurological observation in human brain
has been offered. The model is compatible with a recent model of sequential
behavioral dynamics. The model is based on electrophysiology, but its relevance
to hemodynamics has been outlined.

of supernova (SN) feedback and study how galactic winds from star-forming
galaxies affect the features of hydrogen (HI) and metal (CIV and OVI)

the outflows tend to escape to low density regions, and hardly affect the dense
filaments visible in HI absorption. As a result, the strength of HI absorption
near galaxies is not reduced by galactic winds, but even slightly increases. We
also find that a lack of HI absorption for lines of sight (LOS) close to
galaxies, as found by Adelberger et al., can be created by hot gas around the
galaxies induced by accretion shock heating. In contrast to HI, metal
absorption systems are sensitive to the presence of winds. The models without
feedback can produce the strong CIV and OVI absorption lines in LOS within 50
kpc from galaxies, while strong SN feedback is capable of creating strong CIV
and OVI lines out to about twice that distance. We also analyze the mean
transmissivity of HI, CIV, and OVI within 1 h$^{-1}$ Mpc from star-forming
galaxies. The probability distribution of the transmissivity of HI is
independent of the strength of SN feedback, but strong feedback produces LOS
with lower transmissivity of metal lines. Additionally, strong feedback can
produce strong OVI lines even in cases where HI absorption is weak. We conclude
that OVI is probably the best tracer for galactic winds at high redshift.

lightcurve skewness in the g-r vs. u-g color-color diagram on the main stellar

field using observed stellar FUV and EUV emission and the diffuse soft X-ray
background. We also model the emission from the boundary between the LIC and
the hot Local Bubble (LB) plasma, assuming that the cloud is evaporating
because of thermal conduction. We create a grid of models covering a plausible
range of LIC and LB properties, and use the modeled radiation field as input to
radiative transfer/thermal equilibrium calculations using the Cloudy code. Data
from in situ observations of He^O, pickup ions and anomalous cosmic rays in the
heliosphere, and absorption line measurements towards epsilon CMa were used to
constrain the input parameters. A restricted range of assumed LIC HI column
densities and LB plasma temperatures produce models that match all the
observational constraints. The relative weakness of the constraints on N(HI)
and T_h contrast with the narrow limits predicted for the H^O and electron
density in the LIC at the Sun, n(H^0) = 0.19 - 0.20 cm^-3, and n(e) = 0.07 +/-
0.01 cm^-3. Derived abundances are mostly typical for low density gas, with
sub-solar Mg, Si and Fe, possibly subsolar O and N, and S about solar; however
C is supersolar. The interstellar gas at the Sun is warm, low density, and
partially ionized, with n(H) = 0.23 - 0.27 cm^-3, T = 6300 K, X(H^+) ~ 0.2, and
X(He^+) ~ 0.4. These results appear to be robust since acceptable models are
found for substantially different input radiation fields. Our results favor low

the GRB is produced by the collapse of the rapidly rotating core of a massive

suggests low-metallicity to be a condition for a massive star to evolve to the
collapsar stage. Both completely-mixed single star models and binary star
models are possible. In binary models the progenitor of the GRB is a massive
helium star with a close companion. We find that tidal synchronization during
core-helium burning is reached on a short timescale (less than a few
millennia). However, the strong core-envelope coupling in the subsequent
evolutionary stages is likely to rule out helium stars with main-sequence
companions as progenitors of hypernovae/GRBs. On the other hand, helium stars
in close binaries with a neutron-star or black-hole companion can, despite the
strong core-envelope coupling in the post-helium burning phase, retain

along DNA. Accordingly, a multiscale approach is necessary to capture the
electronic behavior of the stretched DNA helix. To construct such a model, we
begin with accurate density-functional-theory calculations for electronic
states in DNA bases and base pairs in various relative configurations
encountered in the equilibrium and stretched forms. These results are
complemented by semi-empirical quantum mechanical calculations for the states
of a small size [18 base pair poly(CG)-poly(CG)] dry, neutral DNA sequence,
using previously published models for stretched DNA. The calculated electronic
states are then used to parametrize an effective tight-binding model that can
describe electron hopping in the presence of environmental effects, such as the
presence of stray water molecules on the backbone or structural features of the
substrate. These effects introduce disorder in the model hamiltonian which
leads to electron localization. The localization length is smaller by several
orders of magnitude in stretched DNA relative to that in the unstretched
structure.

partonic system during the prethermal and thermal stages through the partonic
channels ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] and ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J]x, and then they
dissociate in the latter two stages. Dissociation of ccbar in the medium occurs
via two reactions: (a) color singlet ccbar plus a gluon turns to color octet
ccbar, (b) color octet ccbar plus a gluon persists as color octet. There are
modest yields of ccbar in the prethermal stage at RHIC energy and through the
reactions ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] at LHC energy for partons with large average
momentum in the prethermal stage at both collider energies and in the thermal
stage at LHC energy. Production from the partonic system competes with the
suppression of the initial yield in the deconfined medium. Consequently, a
bulge within -1.5<y<1.5 has been found for the J/psi number distribution and
the ratio of J/psi number distributions for Au-Au collisions to nucleon-nucleon

association Cygnus OB2.
  Methods: We present new spectroscopic observations allowing a reliable

its associated bow shock and astrometric information not previously studied.
  Results: Our observations reveal that BD+43 3654 is a very early and luminous
star of spectral type O4If, with an estimated mass of (70 +/- 15) solar masses
and an age of about 1.6 Myr. The high spatial resolution of the MSX
observations allows us to determine its direction of motion in the plane of the
sky by means of the symmetry axis of the well-defined bow shock, which matches
well the orientation expected from the proper motion. Tracing back its path
across the sky we find that BD+43 3654 was located near the central, densest

  Conclusions: BD+43 3654 turns out to be one of the three most massive runaway

singular point is an algebraic branch solution. In particular a global solution
is an algebraic solution if and only if it is finitely many-valued globally.
The proof of this result relies on algebraic geometry of Painleve VI,
Riemann-Hilbert correspondence, geometry and dynamics on cubic surfaces,
resolutions of Kleinian singularities, and power geometry of algebraic
differential equations. In the course of the proof we are also able to classify
all finite branch solutions up to Backlund transformations.

existence of a partially disordered chiral state at ambient pressure in the

the analysis of the spin-wave spectrum. We demonstrate that the square of the

the number of gas particles is fixed. Neishtadt and Sinai previously pointed
out that an averaging theorem due to Anosov should extend to this situation.

behavior is $\mathcal{O} (M^ {-1/2}) $ on the time scale $M^ {1/2} $. The
convergence is uniform over all initial conditions in a compact set. We also

both over initial conditions and over the amount of smoothing.

The Green's tensor approach permits computation of the phase and amplitude

shown that the field diffracted along the interface by the groove is equivalent
to replacing the groove by an oscillating dipolar line source. An analytic
expression is derived from the Green's function formalism, that reproduces well
the asymptotic surface plasmon polariton (SPP) wave as well as the transient

optical, and X-ray emission associated with the SNR and is probably a radiative
SNR shell. This is the first detection of a SNR shell in this near/mid-infrared

focussed much attention during the last years. However, to our best knowledge,

ill-posed by proving the compactness of the Hessian at the global minimizer.

motion becomes to be nearly regular (the so-called ``stagnant motion'') for a

different chaotic behaviours affect on observation of gravitational waves, we
investigate a correlation of the particle motion and the waves. We find that
such a difference in chaotic motions reflects on the wave forms and energy

suggests that we may make a distinction between different chaotic behaviours of

emitted by this object, however, is inconsistent with a hard state
interpretation. The accretion rate of NGC 3783 (~7% of the Eddington rate) is
similar to that of other AGN with `soft' state PSDs and higher than that at
which the GBH Cyg X-1, with which AGN are often compared, changes between
`hard' and `soft' states (~2% of the Eddington rate). If NGC 3783 really does
have a `hard' state PSD, it would be quite unusual and would indicate that AGN
and GBHs are not quite as similar as we currently believe. Here we present an
improved X-ray PSD of NGC 3783, spanning from ~10^{-8} to ~10^{-3} Hz, based on
considerably extended (5.5 years) RXTE observations combined with two orbits of
continuous observation by XMM-Newton. We show that this PSD is, in fact, well
fitted by a `soft' state model which has only one break, at high frequencies.
Although a `hard' state model can also fit the data, the improvement in fit by
adding a second break at low frequency is not significant. Thus NGC 3783 is not
unusual. These results leave Arakelian 564 as the only AGN which shows a second
break at low frequencies, although in that case the very high accretion rate
implies a `very high', rather than `hard' state PSD. The break frequency found
in NGC 3783 is consistent with the expectation based on comparisons with other
AGN and GBHs, given its black hole mass and accretion rate.

makes it exceedingly difficult for routers to examine every packet in order to
keep detailed statistics about the traffic which is traversing the router.
Sampling is commonly applied on routers in order to limit the load incurred by
the collection of information that the router has to undertake when evaluating
flow information for monitoring purposes. The sampling process in nearly all
cases is a deterministic process of choosing 1 in every N packets on a
per-interface basis, and then forming the flow statistics based on the
collected sampled statistics. Even though this sampling may not be significant
for some statistics, such as packet rate, others can be severely distorted.
However, it is important to consider the sampling techniques and their relative
accuracy when applied to different traffic patterns. The main disadvantage of
sampling is the loss of accuracy in the collected trace when compared to the
original traffic stream. To date there has not been a detailed analysis of the
impact of sampling at a router in various traffic profiles and flow criteria.
In this paper, we assess the performance of the sampling process as used in
NetFlow in detail, and we discuss some techniques for the compensation of loss

energy functional, the tensor terms originate both from zero-range central and

range of the parameter space of the isoscalar and isovector tensor term
coupling constants, with a fit protocol very similar to that of the successful
SLy parameterizations. We analyze the impact of the tensor terms on a large
variety of observables in spherical mean-field calculations, such as the
spin-orbit splittings and single-particle spectra of doubly-magic nuclei, the
evolution of spin-orbit splittings along chains of semi-magic nuclei, mass
residuals of spherical nuclei, and known anomalies of charge radii. Our main
conclusion is that the currently used central and spin-orbit parts of the
Skyrme energy density functional are not flexible enough to allow for the
presence of large tensor terms.

keV band from the HELLAS2XMM survey.
  Methods: We use IRAC and MIPS 24 micron observations, along with optical and
Ks-band photometry, to obtain the SEDs of the sources. The observed SEDs are
modeled using a combination of an elliptical template and torus emission (using
the phenomenological templates of Silva et al. 2004) for six sources associated
with passive galaxies; for two point-like sources, the empirical SEDs of red
quasars are adopted. The bolometric luminosities and the M_BH-L_K relation are
used to provide an estimate of the masses and Eddington ratios of the black
holes residing in these AGN.
  Results: All of our sources are detected in the IRAC and MIPS (at 24 micron)
bands. The SED modeling described above is in good agreement with the observed
near- and mid-infrared data. The derived bolometric luminosities are in the
range ~10^45-10^47 erg s^-1, and the median 2--10 keV bolometric correction is
~25, consistent with the widely adopted value derived by Elvis et al. (1994).
For the objects with elliptical-like profiles in the K_s band, we derive high
stellar masses (0.8-6.2)X10^11 Mo, black hole masses in the range
(0.2-2.5)X10^9 Mo, and Eddington ratios L/L_Edd<0.1, suggesting a low-accretion

the sum of $p$ characteristic functions of disjoint discs of radius $p^{-1}$.
The case $p=2$ is studied in detail. Our MRA is a 2-adic analog of the real
Haar MRA. But in contrast to the real setting, the refinable function
generating our Haar MRA is periodic with period 1, which never holds for real
refinable functions. This fact implies that there exist infinity many different
2-adic orthonormal wavelet bases in ${\cL}^2(\bQ_2)$ generated by the same Haar
MRA. All of these bases are constructed. Since $p$-adic pseudo-differential

complex community structure, capturing highly connected circles of friends,
families, or professional cliques in a social network. Thanks to frequent
changes in the activity and communication patterns of individuals, the

Our knowledge of the mechanisms governing the underlying community dynamics is
limited, but is essential for a deeper understanding of the development and
self-optimisation of the society as a whole. We have developed a new algorithm
based on clique percolation, that allows, for the first time, to investigate
the time dependence of overlapping communities on a large scale and as such, to
uncover basic relationships characterising community evolution. Our focus is on
networks capturing the collaboration between scientists and the calls between
mobile phone users. We find that large groups persist longer if they are
capable of dynamically altering their membership, suggesting that an ability to
change the composition results in better adaptability. The behaviour of small
groups displays the opposite tendency, the condition for stability being that
their composition remains unchanged. We also show that the knowledge of the
time commitment of the members to a given community can be used for estimating
the community's lifetime. These findings offer a new view on the fundamental
differences between the dynamics of small groups and large institutions.

defined but the properties of each subsystem are not. Entanglement is at the
heart of quantum physics, both for its conceptual foundations and for
applications in information processing and quantum communication. Remarkably,
entanglement can be ""swapped"": if one prepares two independent entangled pairs
A1-A2 and B1-B2, a joint measurement on A1 and B1 (called a ""Bell-State
Measurement"", BSM) has the effect of projecting A2 and B2 onto an entangled
state, although these two particles have never interacted or shared any common
past[1,2]. Experiments using twin photons produced by spontaneous parametric
down-conversion (SPDC) have already demonstrated entanglement swapping[3-6],
but here we present its first realization using continuous wave (CW) sources,
as originally proposed[2]. The challenge was to achieve sufficiently sharp
synchronization of the photons in the BSM. Using narrow-band filters, the
coherence time of the photons that undergo the BSM is significantly increased,
exceeding the temporal resolution of the detectors. Hence pulsed sources can be
replaced by CW sources, which do not require any synchronization[6,7], allowing
for the first time the use of completely autonomous sources. Our experiment
exploits recent progress in the time precision of photon detectors, in the
efficiency of photon pair production by SPDC with waveguides in nonlinear
crystals[8], and in the stability of narrow-band filters. This approach is
independent of the form of entanglement; we employed time-bin entangled
photons[9] at telecom wavelengths. Our setup is robust against thermal or
mechanical fluctuations in optical fibres thanks to cm-long coherence lengths.

moreover, every weak solution of the Euler equations that belongs to

dramatically change the tunneling behavior. We predict that in general the

propagate from Alice or Bob's changing magnetic field, through space, to the
other detector, arriving before the particle and thereby allowing a local

be due to the dominant influence of a common market mode on the stock prices.
By comparison, interactions between related stocks, e.g., those belonging to
the same business sector, are much weaker. This lack of distinct sector
identity in emerging markets is explicitly shown by reconstructing the network
of mutually interacting stocks. Spectral analysis of C for NSE reveals that,
the few largest eigenvalues deviate from the bulk of the spectrum predicted by
random matrix theory, but they are far fewer in number compared to, e.g., NYSE.
We show this to be due to the relative weakness of intra-sector interactions

signature of market development.

local galaxy density, distance from the nearest cluster centre, local surface
mass density from weak lensing, and photometric classification. At high local
galaxy densities, log(Sigma_10 /Mpc^2) > 1.5, a classical morphology-density
relation is found. A correlation is also found between morphology and local
projected surface mass density, but no trend is observed with distance to the
nearest cluster. This supports the finding that local environment is more
important to galaxy morphology than global cluster properties. The breakdown of
the morphological catalogue by colour shows a dominance of blue galaxies in the
galaxies displaying late-type morphologies and a corresponding dominance of red
galaxies in the early-type population. Using the 17-band photometry from
COMBO-17, we further split the supercluster red sequence into old passive

cataclysmic variable progenitor systems. Given that approximately 25% of
cataclysmic variables contain a magnetic white dwarf, and that our large sample
of close binary systems should contain many progenitors of cataclysmic
variables, it is quite surprising that we find only two potential magnetic
white dwarfs in this sample. The candidate magnetic white dwarfs, if confirmed,
would possess relatively low magnetic field strengths (B_WD < 10 MG) that are
similar to those of intermediate-Polars but are much less than the average
field strength of the current Polar population. Additional observations of
these systems are required to definitively cast the white dwarfs as magnetic.
Even if these two systems prove to be the first evidence of detached magnetic
white dwarf + M dwarf binaries, there is still a large disparity between the
properties of the presently known cataclysmic variable population and the
presumed close binary progenitors.

bursts (GRBs) with known redshift, all of them detected by the Swift satellite.
Due to the narrow energy range (15-150 keV) of the Swift-BAT detector, the
spectral fitting is reliable only for fitting models with 2 or 3 parameters. As
high uncertainty and correlation among the errors is expected, a careful
analysis of the errors is necessary. We fit both the power law (PL, 2
parameters) and cut--off power law (CPL, 3 parameters) models to the
time-integrated spectra of the 47 bursts, and present the corresponding
parameters, their uncertainties, and the correlations among the uncertainties.
The CPL model is reliable only for 29 bursts for which we estimate the nuf_nu
peak energy Epk. For these GRBs, we calculate the energy fluence and the rest-
frame isotropic-equivalent radiated energy, Eiso, as well as the propagated
uncertainties and correlations among them. We explore the distribution of our
homogeneous sample of GRBs on the rest-frame diagram E'pk vs Eiso. We confirm a
significant correlation between these two quantities (the ""Amati"" relation) and
we verify that, within the uncertainty limits, no outliers are present. We also
fit the spectra to a Band model with the high energy power law index frozen to
-2.3, obtaining a rather good agreement with the ""Amati"" relation of non-Swift

correlation between star formation rate and gas surface or volume density,
depend on the molecular line chosen to trace the gas. We show that, for lines
that can be excited at low temperatures, the KS law depends on how the line
critical density compares to the median density in a galaxy's star-forming
molecular clouds. High critical density lines trace regions with similar
physical properties across galaxy types, and this produces a linear correlation
between line luminosity and star formation rate. Low critical density lines
probe regions whose properties vary across galaxies, leading to a star
formation rate that varies superlinearly with line luminosity. We show that a
simple model in which molecular clouds are treated as isothermal and homogenous
can quantitatively reproduce the observed correlations between galactic
luminosities in far infrared and in the CO(1->0) and HCN(1->0) lines, and
naturally explains why these correlations have different slopes. We predict
that IR-line luminosity correlations should change slope for galaxies in which
the median density is close to the line critical density. This prediction may
be tested by observations of lines such as HCO^+(1->0) with intermediate
critical densities, or by HCN(1->0) observations of intensely star-forming high
redshift galaxies with very high densities. Recent observations by Gao et al.
hint at just such a change in slope. We argue that deviations from linearity in
the HCN(1->0)-IR correlation at high luminosity are consistent with the
assumption of a constant star formation efficiency.

corresponding to the exact chiral symmetry of staggered quarks. The treatment
assumes the validity of the standard prescription for representing the
staggered ``fourth root trick'' within \schpt by insertions of factors of 1/4
for each sea quark loop. Our calculation is based on an existing partially
quenched continuum chiral perturbation theory calculation with degenerate sea
quarks by Becirevic, Prelovsek and Zupan, which we generalize to the staggered

non-leading chiral terms, and find a relation among the coefficients governing
the analytic valence mass dependence at this order. Our results are useful in
analyzing lattice computations of form factors $B\to\pi$ and $D\to K$ when the

recovers information about fluctuations lost in passing to the reduced density
matrix. For the case of fluctuations arising from a classical probability
distribution, the hierarchy is formed from expectations of products of pure
state density matrix elements, and can be compactly summarized by a simple
generating function. For the case of quantum fluctuations arising when a
quantum system interacts with a quantum environment in an overall pure state,
the corresponding hierarchy is defined as the environmental trace of products
of system matrix elements of the full density matrix. Only the lowest member of
the quantum noise hierarchy is directly experimentally measurable. The unit
trace and idempotence properties of the pure state density matrix imply descent
relations for the tensor hierarchies, that relate the order $n$ tensor, under
contraction of appropriate pairs of tensor indices, to the order $n-1$ tensor.
As examples to illustrate the classical probability distribution formalism, we
consider a quantum system evolving by It\^o stochastic and by jump process
Schr\""odinger equations. As examples to illustrate the corresponding trace
formalism in the quantum fluctuation case, we consider collisional Brownian
motion of an infinite mass Brownian particle, and the weak coupling Born-Markov
master equation. In different specializations, the latter gives the hierarchies
generalizing the quantum optical master equation and the Caldeira--Leggett
master equation. As a further application of the density tensor, we contrast
stochastic Schr\""odinger equations that reduce and that do not reduce the state
vector, and discuss why a quantum system coupled to a quantum environment
behaves like the latter.

spin evolution of Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) are modeled using the triplet
of modes at the lowest parametric instability threshold. We solve numerically
the coupled equations for the three mode amplitudes in conjunction with the
spin and temperature evolution equations. We observe that very quickly the mode
amplitudes settle into quasi-stationary states. Once these states are reached,
the mode amplitudes can be found algebraically and the system of equations is
reduced from eight to two equations: spin and temperature evolution.
Eventually, the system may reach thermal equilibrium and either (1) undergo a
cyclic evolution with a frequency change of at most 10%, (2) evolve toward a
full equilibrium state in which the accretion torque balances the gravitational
radiation emission, or (3) enter a thermogravitational runaway on a very long
timescale of about $10^6$ years. Alternatively, a faster thermal runaway
(timescale of about 100 years) may occur. The sources of damping considered are
shear viscosity, hyperon bulk viscosity and boundary layer viscosity. We vary
proprieties of the star such as the hyperon superfluid transition temperature
T_c, the fraction of the star that is above the threshold for direct URCA
reactions, and slippage factor, and map the different scenarios we obtain to
ranges of these parameters. For all our bound evolutions the r-mode amplitude
remains small $\sim 10^{-5}$. The spin frequency is limited by boundary layer
viscosity to $\nu_{max} \sim 800 Hz [S_{ns}/(M_{1.4} R_6)]^{4/11} T_8^{-2/11}$.
We find that for $\nu > 700$ Hz the r-mode instability would be active for
about 1 in 1000 LMXBs and that only the gravitational waves from LMXBs in the
local group of galaxies could be detected by advanced LIGO interferometers.

information hiding applications, such as partnership bidding with allocative
externality or concerns about revealing bidding preferences. The protocol
applies to a variety of auction types, e.g., first or second price, and to
auctions involving either a single item or arbitrary bundles of items (i.e.,
combinatorial auctions). We analyze the game-theoretical behavior of the

f(x-yv(x)) \frac{dy}y where $ \epsilon $ is a suitably chosen parameter,
determined by the smoothness properties of the vector field. It is a
conjecture, due to E.\thinspace M.\thinspace Stein, that if $ v$ is Lipschitz,
there is a positive $ \epsilon $ for which the transform above is bounded on $
L ^{2}$. Our principal result gives a sufficient condition in terms of the
boundedness of a maximal function associated to $ v$. This sufficient condition
is that this new maximal function be bounded on some $ L ^{p}$, for some $
1<p<2$. We show that the maximal function is bounded from $ L ^{2}$ to weak $ L
^{2}$ for all Lipschitz maximal function. The relationship between our results
and other known sufficient conditions is explored.

surveys have been the backbone of astronomy, and the main engine of discovery,
as we have mapped the sky at every possible wavelength. Surveys are an
efficient use of resources. They are important as a fundamental resource; to
map intrinsically large structures; to gain the necessary statistics to address
some problems; and to find very rare objects. I summarise major recent wide
field surveys - 2MASS, SDSS, 2dfGRS, and UKIDSS - and look at examples of the
exciting science they have produced, covering the structure of the Milky Way,
the measurement of cosmological parameters, the creation of a new field
studying substellar objects, and the ionisation history of the Universe. I then
look briefly at upcoming projects in the optical-IR survey arena - VISTA,
PanSTARRS, WISE, and LSST. Finally I ask, now we have opened up essentially all
wavelength windows, whether the exploration of survey discovery space is ended.
I examine other possible axes of discovery space, and find them mostly to be
too expensive to explore or otherwise unfruitful, with two exceptions : the
first is the time axis, which we have only just begun to explore properly; and
the second is the possibility of neutrino astrophysics.

0.457 and 1.807) and metallicity between [Fe/H] = -0.82 and 0.6. We obtained
medium resolution echelle spectra using the 2.15-m telescope at the argentinian
observatory CASLEO. The observations have been performed periodically since
1999. The spectra were calibrated in wavelength and in flux. A definition of
the pseudo-continuum level is found for all our observations. We also define a
continuum level for calibration purposes. The equivalent width of the D lines
is computed in detail for all our spectra and related to the colour index (B-V)
of the stars. When possible, we perform a careful comparison with previous
studies. Finally, we construct a spectral index (R_D') as the ratio between the
flux in the D lines, and the bolometric flux. We find that, once corrected for
the photospheric contribution, this index can be used as a chromospheric
activity indicator in stars with a high level of activity. Additionally, we
find that combining some of our results, we obtain a method to calibrate in
flux stars of unknown colour.

coefficient within the ring is assumed to follow a power law dependence with
the distance from the central mass as, k=k0r^{-q}. We have calculated
position-velocity diagrams for the most intense maser features, for different
values of the exponent q. We have found that, depending on the value of q,
these diagrams can be qualitatively different. The most intense maser emission
at a given velocity can either come mainly from regions close to the inner or
outer edges of the amplifying ring or from the line perpendicular to the line
of sight and passing through the central mass (as is commonly assumed).
Particularly, when q>1 the position-velocity diagram is qualitatively similar
to the one observed for the water maser emission in the nucleus of the galaxy
NGC 4258. In the context of this simple model, we conclude that in this object
the absorption coefficient depends on the radius of the amplifying ring as a
decreasing function, in order to have significant emission coming from the

produce considerably more pronounced commensuration peaks in the critical
depinning force than triangular pinning arrays, and also cause additional peaks
at noninteger matching fields where a portion of the vortices are located in
the large interstitial regions of the pinning lattices. For the honeycomb
pinning array, we find matching effects of equal strength at most fillings
B/B_\phi=n/2 for n>2, where n is an integer, in agreement with recent
experiments. For kagome pinning arrays, pronounced matching effects generally
occur at B/B_\phi=n/3 for n>3, while for triangular pinning arrays pronounced
matching effects are observed only at integer fillings B/B_\phi=n. At the
noninteger matching field peaks in the honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays, the
interstitial vortices are arranged in dimer, trimer, and higher order n-mer
states that have an overall orientational order. We call these n-mer states
""vortex molecular crystals"" and ""vortex plastic crystals"" since they are
similar to the states recently observed in colloidal molecular crystal systems.

For average lobe magnetic fields of >~0.3-1 micro-G, the lobe spectra are
predicted to extend into the soft gamma-rays making them likely detectable with
the GLAST LAT. If detected, their large angular extents (~1 deg and 8 deg) will
make it possible to ``image'' the radio lobes in gamma-rays. Similarly, this

  Distributions",Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,,,,"['cs.IT', 'math.IT']",,"  We study universal compression of sequences generated by monotonic
distributions. We show that for a monotonic distribution over an alphabet of
size $k$, each probability parameter costs essentially $0.5 \log (n/k^3)$ bits,
where $n$ is the coded sequence length, as long as $k = o(n^{1/3})$. Otherwise,
for $k = O(n)$, the total average sequence redundancy is $O(n^{1/3+\epsilon})$
bits overall. We then show that there exists a sub-class of monotonic
distributions over infinite alphabets for which redundancy of
$O(n^{1/3+\epsilon})$ bits overall is still achievable. This class contains
fast decaying distributions, including many distributions over the integers and
geometric distributions. For some slower decays, including other distributions
over the integers, redundancy of $o(n)$ bits overall is achievable, where a
method to compute specific redundancy rates for such distributions is derived.
The results are specifically true for finite entropy monotonic distributions.
Finally, we study individual sequence redundancy behavior assuming a sequence
is governed by a monotonic distribution. We show that for sequences whose
empirical distributions are monotonic, individual redundancy bounds similar to
those in the average case can be obtained. However, even if the monotonicity in
the empirical distribution is violated, diminishing per symbol individual
sequence redundancies with respect to the monotonic maximum likelihood
description length may still be achievable.

$<qq>$ in vacuum is generally made by relativistic effective potentials in the
mean field approximation in 2D, 3D and 4D models with two flavor and $N_c$
color massless fermions. It is found that in ground states of these models,
interplay between the two condensates mainly depend on the ratio $G_S/H_S$ for
2D and 4D case or $G_S/H_P$ for 3D case, where $G_S$, $H_S$ and $H_P$ are
respectively the coupling constants in a scalar $(\bar{q}q)$, a scalar $(qq)$
and a pseudoscalar $(qq)$ channel. In ground states of all the models, only
pure $<\bar{q}q>$ condensates could exist if $G_S/H_S$ or $G_S/H_P$ is bigger
than the critical value $2/N_c$, the ratio of the color numbers of the fermions
entering into the condensates $<qq>$ and $<\bar{q}q>$. As $G_S/H_S$ or
$G_S/H_P$ decreases to the region below $2/N_c$, differences of the models will
manifest themselves. Depending on different models, and also on $N_c$ in 3D

elliptical galaxies was a major surprise in 1969. While it is now clear that
this UV excess is caused by an old population of hot helium-burning stars
without large hydrogen-rich envelopes, rather than young stars, their origin
has remained a mystery. Here we show that these stars most likely lost their
envelopes because of binary interactions, similar to the hot subdwarf
population in our own Galaxy. We have developed an evolutionary population
synthesis model for the far-UV excess of elliptical galaxies based on the
binary model developed by Han et al (2002, 2003) for the formation of hot
subdwarfs in our Galaxy. Despite its simplicity, it successfully reproduces
most of the properties of elliptical galaxies with a UV excess: the range of
observed UV excesses, both in $(1550-V)$ and $(2000-V)$, and their evolution
with redshift. We also present colour-colour diagrams for use as diagnostic
tools in the study of elliptical galaxies. The model has major implications for
understanding the evolution of the UV excess and of elliptical galaxies in
general. In particular, it implies that the UV excess is not a sign of age, as
had been postulated previously, and predicts that it should not be strongly
dependent on the metallicity of the population, but exists universally from
dwarf ellipticals to giant ellipticals.

known as IntraDay Variability, can be explained in at least some sources by a
source-extrinsic effect, in which the variations are interpreted as
scintillation of radio waves caused by the turbulent ISM of the Milky Way. One
of the most convincing observational arguments in favour of propagation-induced
variability is the so called annual modulation of the characteristic
variability time-scale, which is due to the orbital motion of the Earth. Data
for the recently discovered and highly variable IDV source J1128+5925 are
presented. We study the frequency and time dependence of the IDV in this
compact quasar. We measure the characteristic variability time-scale of the IDV
throughout the year, and analyze whether the observed changes in the
variability time-scale are consistent with annual modulation. We monitored the
flux density variability of J1128+5925 with dense time sampling between 2.7 and
10.45GHz with the 100m Effelsberg radio telescope of the MPIfR and with the 25m
Urumqi radio telescope. From ten observing sessions, we determine the
variability characteristics and time-scales. The observed pronounced changes of
the variability time-scale of J1128+5925 are modelled with an anisotropic
annual modulation model. The observed frequency dependence of the variation is
in good agreement with the prediction from interstellar scintillation. Adopting
a simple model for the annual modulation model and using also the frequency
dependence of the IDV, we derive a lower limit to the distance of the
scattering screen and an upper limit to the scintillating source size. The
latter is found to be consistent with the measured core size from VLBI.

planets, and a high rate is supported by the first detections of low-mass

In previous work a similar scaling rule was found at the level of research
groups. Therefore we conjecture that this scaling rule is a prevalent property
of the science system. We observe that lower performance universities have a
larger size-dependent cumulative advantage for receiving citations than
top-performance universities. We also find that for the lower-performance
universities the fraction of not-cited publications decreases considerably with
size. Generally, the higher the average journal impact of the publications of a
university, the lower the number of not-cited publications. We find that the
average research performance does not dilute with size. Large top-performance
universities succeed in keeping a high performance over a broad range of
activities. This most probably is an indication of their scientific attractive
power. Next we find that particularly for the lower-performance universities
the field citation density provides a strong cumulative advantage in citations
per publication. The relation between number of citations and field citation
density found in this study can be considered as a second basic scaling rule of
the science system. Top-performance universities publish in journals with

(BSNRs) observed in the radio band is determined mainly either by a non-uniform
interstellar medium (ISM) or by a non-uniform ambient magnetic field.
  METHODS: We perform 3-D MHD simulations of a spherical SNR shock propagating
through a magnetized ISM. Two cases of shock propagation are considered: 1)
through a gradient of ambient density with a uniform ambient magnetic field; 2)
through a homogeneous medium with a gradient of ambient magnetic field
strength. From the simulations, we synthesize the synchrotron radio emission,
making different assumptions about the details of acceleration and injection of
relativistic electrons.
  RESULTS: We find that asymmetric BSNRs are produced if the line-of-sight is
not aligned with the gradient of ambient plasma density or with the gradient of
ambient magnetic field strength. We derive useful parameters to quantify the
degree of asymmetry of the remnants that may provide a powerful diagnostic of
the microphysics of strong shock waves through the comparison between models
and observations.
  CONCLUSIONS: BSNRs with two radio limbs of different brightness can be
explained if a gradient of ambient density or, most likely, of ambient magnetic
field strength is perpendicular to the radio limbs. BSNRs with converging
similar radio arcs can be explained if the gradient runs between the two arcs.

0704.0892,Nonstationary pattern in unsynchronizable complex networks,"11 pages, 9 figures, preprints. Comments and suggestions are welcome",,,,['nlin.CD'],,"  Pattern formation and evolution in unsynchronizable complex networks are
investigated. Due to the asymmetric topology, the synchronous patterns formed
in complex networks are irregular and nonstationary. For coupling strength
immediately out of the synchronizable region, the typical phenomenon is the
on-off intermittency of the system dynamics. The patterns appeared in this
process are signatured by the coexistence of a giant cluster, which comprises
most of the nodes, and a few number of small clusters. The pattern evolution is
characterized by the giant cluster irregularly absorbs or emits the small
clusters. As the coupling strength leaves away from the synchronization
bifurcation point, the giant cluster is gradually dissolved into a number of
small clusters, and the system dynamics is characterized by the integration and
separation of the small clusters. Dynamical mechanisms and statistical
properties of the nonstationary pattern evolution are analyzed and conducted,
and some scalings are newly revealed. Remarkably, it is found that the few
active nodes, which escape from the giant cluster with a high frequency, are
independent of the coupling strength while are sensitive to the bifurcation
types. We hope our findings about nonstationary pattern could give additional
understandings to the dynamics of complex systems and have implications to some
real problems where systems maintain their normal functions only in the
unsynchronizable state.

converted the photometry values to fluxes and fit them to a spectral energy

hydrogen, pure helium, or metal-rich helium), resulting in estimates of
effective temperature and distance. Eight of the new and 12 known systems are
estimated to be within the NStars and Catalogue of Nearby Stars (CNS) horizons

dwarfs identified in recent years with significant absorption in the infrared

gives rise to considerable effects for non-asymptotic critical dynamics. We
investigate this phenomenon by a field-theoretical renormalization group

quantitative estimates for the effective and asymptotic critical exponents of
the order parameter and scalar density. The results predict complex scenarios

Weights and of Mass Number of atomic nuclei. Using the AutoCorrelation Function
and Mutual Information we establish the presence of nonlinear effects in the
mechanism of increasing mass of atomic nuclei considered as a function of the
atomic number. We find that increasing mass is divergent, possibly chaotic. We
also investigate the possible existence of a Power Law for atomic nuclei and,
using also the technique of the variogram, we conclude that a fractal regime
could superintend to the mechanism of increasing mass for nuclei. Finally,
using the Hurst exponent, evidence is obtained that the mechanism of increasing
mass in atomic nuclei is in the fractional Brownian regime. The most
interesting results are obtained by using Recurrence Quantification Analysis
(RQA). New recurrences, psudoperiodicities, self-resemblance and class of
self-similarities are identified with values of determinism showing oscillating
values indicating the presence of more or less stability during the process of
increasing mass of atomic nuclei. In brief, new regimes of regularities are
identified for atomic nuclei that deserve to be studied by future researches.
In particular an accurate analysis of binding energy values by nonlinear
methods is further required.

double cores. One type is not common locally and is apparently a loose
assemblage of smaller galaxies. Photometric measurements were made of the tails
and clumps, and physical sizes were determined assuming photometric redshifts.
Antennae tails are a factor of ~3 smaller in GEMS and GOODS systems compared to
local antennae; their disks are a factor of ~2 smaller than locally. Collisions
among early type galaxies generally show no fine structure in their tails,
indicating that stellar debris is usually not unstable. One exception has a

is minimized for fixed magnetization. The results can be easily visualized in
terms of a plot of the energy as a function of magnetic moment m_z, in which
both the switching field [the maximum slope of E(m_z)] and the stability
(determined by the energy barrier E_b) are geometrically visible. In this
formulation we can prove a rigorous limit on the figure of merit xi, which can
be no higher than 4. We also show that a quadratic anistropy suggested by Suess

many families by studying the n-level densities; for suitably restricted test
functions the main terms agree with random matrix theory. In particular, all
one-parameter families of elliptic curves with rank r over Q(T) and the same
distribution of signs of functional equations have the same limiting behavior.
We break this universality and find family dependent lower order correction

excess rank to modeling the behavior of zeros near the central point, and
depend on the arithmetic of the family. We derive an alternate form of the

sums over powers of Satake parameters by sums of the moments of the Fourier

a second modulus which is automatically stabilized and acts as a source of cold

However, any attempt to saturate the present cold dark matter component in this
manner leads to unacceptable deviations from cosmological data -- a numerical
study reveals that this source can account for up to about 7% of the total cold

mass ratio $n < 2$ and with a combined cold gas mass fraction $F_{\rm cold} <
0.1$. Our model accurately reproduces the observed fraction of boxy systems as
a function of luminosity and halo mass, for both central galaxies and
satellites. After correcting for the stellar mass dependence, the properties of
the last major merger of early-type galaxies are independent of their halo
mass. This provides theoretical support for the conjecture of Pasquali et al
(2007) that the stellar mass of an early-type galaxy is the main parameter that
governs its isophotal shape. We argue that the observed dichotomy of early-type
galaxies has a natural explanation within hierarchical structure formation, and
does not require AGN feedback. Rather, we argue that it owes to the fact that
more massive systems (i) have more massive progenitors, (ii) assemble later,
and (iii) have a larger fraction of early-type progenitors. Each of these three
trends causes the cold gas mass fraction of the progenitors of more massive
early-types to be lower, so that their last major merger was dryer. Finally,
our model predicts that (i) less than 10 percent of all early-type galaxies
form in major mergers that involve two early-type progenitors, (ii) more than
95 percent of all boxy early-type galaxies with $M_* < 2 \times 10^{10} h^{-1}

early-types do not form a supermassive black hole binary at their last major

despite the distortion, the lattice retains a great deal of frustration.
Although sub-extensive, the classical ground state degeneracy remains very
large, growing exponentially with the system perimeter. We consider degeneracy
lifting by thermal and quantum fluctuations. To linear (spin wave) order, the
degeneracy is found to stay intact. Two complementary approaches are therefore
introduced, appropriate to low and high temperatures, which point to the same
ordered pattern. In the low temperature limit, an effective chirality
Hamiltonian is derived from non-linear spin waves which predicts a transition
on increasing $J'/J$, from $\sqrt 3\times \sqrt 3$ type order to a new
ferrimagnetic {\em striped chirality} order with a doubled unit cell. This is
confirmed by a large-N approximation on the O($n$) model on this lattice. While
the saddle point solution produces a line degeneracy, $O(1/n)$ corrections
select the non-trivial wavevector of the striped chirality state. The quantum
limit of spin 1/2 on this lattice is studied via exact small system
diagonalization and compare well with experimental results at intermediate
temperatures. We suggest that the very low temperature spin frozen state seen
in NMR experiments may be related to the disconnected nature of classical
ground states on this lattice, which leads to a prediction for NMR line shapes.

Observatory (CGRO) discovered gamma-ray emission from more than 67 blazars
during its 9 yr lifetime. We conducted an exhaustive search of the EGRET
archives and selected all the blazars that were observed multiple times and
were bright enough to enable a spectral analysis using standard power-law
models. The sample consists of 18 flat-spectrum radio quasars(FSRQs), 6
low-frequency peaked BL Lac objects (LBLs) and 2 high-frequency peaked BL Lac
objects (HBLs). We do not detect any clear pattern in the variation of spectral
index with flux. Some of the blazars do not show any statistical evidence for
spectral variability. The spectrum hardens with increasing flux in a few cases.
There is also evidence for a flux-hardness anticorrelation at low fluxes in
five blazars. The well-observed blazars (3C 279, 3C 273, PKS 0528+134, PKS
1622-297 PKS 0208-512) do not show any overall trend in the long-term spectral
dependence on flux, but the sample shows a mixture of hard and soft states. We
observed a previously unreported spectral hysteresis at weekly timescales in
all three FSRQs for which data from flares lasting for ~(3-4) weeks were
available. All three sources show a counterclockwise rotation, despite the
widely different flux profiles. We analyze the observed spectral behavior in
the context of various inverse Compton mechanisms believed to be responsible
for emission in the EGRET energy range. Our analysis uses the EGRET skymaps
that were regenerated to include the changes in performance during the mission.

recover robust star formation and metallicity histories from galactic spectra.
VESPA uses the full spectral range to construct a galaxy history from synthetic

reliable star formation histories on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis. Our goal is
robustness as opposed to high resolution histories, and the method is designed
to return high time resolution only where the data demand it. In this paper we
detail the method and we present our findings when we apply VESPA to synthetic
and real Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopic data. We show that the
number of parameters that can be recovered from a spectrum depends strongly on
the signal-to-noise, wavelength coverage and presence or absence of a young
population. For a typical SDSS sample of galaxies, we can normally recover
between 2 to 5 stellar populations. We find very good agreement between VESPA

efficiently generate realizations of halo distributions and ionization maps at
high redshifts. Our procedure combines an excursion-set approach with
first-order Lagrangian perturbation theory and operates directly on the linear
density and velocity fields. As such, the achievable dynamic range with our
algorithm surpasses the current practical limit of N-body codes by orders of
magnitude. This is particularly significant in studies of reionization, where
the dynamic range is the principal limiting factor. We test our halo-finding
and HII bubble-finding algorithms independently against N-body simulations with
radiative transfer and obtain excellent agreement. We compute the size
distributions of ionized and neutral regions in our maps. We find even larger
ionized bubbles than do purely analytic models at the same volume-weighted mean
hydrogen neutral fraction. We also generate maps and power spectra of 21-cm
brightness temperature fluctuations, which for the first time include
corrections due to gas bulk velocities. We find that velocities widen the tails
of the temperature distributions and increase small-scale power, though these
effects quickly diminish as reionization progresses. We also include some
preliminary results from a simulation run with the largest dynamic range to
date: a 250 Mpc box that resolves halos with masses M >~ 2.2 x10^8 M_sun. We
show that accurately modeling the late stages of reionization requires such
large scales. The speed and dynamic range provided by our semi-numerical

disk, which suggests a more complex structure than previously thought. To image
the putative circumnuclear molecular gas disk at sub-arcsecond resolution to
better understand both the spatial distribution and kinematics of the molecular
gas. We carried out CO(2-1) and CO(1-0) line observations of the nuclear region
of M51 with the new A configuration of the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer,
yielding a spatial resolution lower than 15 pc. The high resolution images show
no clear evidence of a disk, aligned nearly east-west and perpendicular to the
radio jet axis, as suggested by previous observations, but show two separate
features located on the eastern and western sides of the nucleus. The western
feature shows an elongated structure along the jet and a good velocity
correspondence with optical emission lines associated with the jet, suggesting
that this feature is a jet-entrained gas. The eastern feature is elongated
nearly east-west ending around the nucleus. A velocity gradient appears in the
same direction with increasingly blueshifted velocities near the nucleus. This
velocity gradient is in the opposite sense of that previously inferred for the

gas distribution and kinematics are that a rotating gas disk disturbed by the
jet, gas streaming toward the nucleus, or a ring with another smaller counter-

origin of the nonuniversalities of the prefactors is discussed in the

The nonuniversalities of the prefactors are shown to contribute only to surface
terms of the entropy. Finally, we discuss the experimental relevance of our

find strong evolution compared to the similar-mass Coma cluster. The best
fitting Schechter function gives L*_{IR}=11.49 +0.30/-0.29 L_sun with a fixed
faint end slope, about one order of magnitude larger than that in Coma. The
rate of evolution of the IR luminosity from Coma to MS 1054-03 is consistent
with that found in field galaxies, and it suggests that some internal
mechanism, e.g., the consumption of the gas fuel, is responsible for the
general decline of the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) in different
environments. The mass-normalized integrated SFR within 0.5R_200 in MS 1054-03
also shows evolution compared with other rich clusters at lower redshifts, but
the trend is less conclusive if the mass selection effect is considered. A
nonnegligible fraction (13%) of cluster members, are forming stars actively and
the overdensity of IR galaxies is about 20 compared to the field. It is
unlikely that clusters only passively accrete star forming galaxies from the
surrounding fields and have their star formation quenched quickly afterward;
instead, many cluster galaxies still have large amounts of gas, and their star
formation may be enhanced by the interaction with the cluster.

  Consensus",Submitted to IEEE Transactions,,10.1109/TSP.2008.920143,,"['cs.IT', 'cs.LG', 'math.IT']",,"  In a sensor network, in practice, the communication among sensors is subject
to:(1) errors or failures at random times; (3) costs; and(2) constraints since
sensors and networks operate under scarce resources, such as power, data rate,
or communication. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is usually a main factor in
determining the probability of error (or of communication failure) in a link.
These probabilities are then a proxy for the SNR under which the links operate.
The paper studies the problem of designing the topology, i.e., assigning the
probabilities of reliable communication among sensors (or of link failures) to
maximize the rate of convergence of average consensus, when the link
communication costs are taken into account, and there is an overall
communication budget constraint. To consider this problem, we address a number
of preliminary issues: (1) model the network as a random topology; (2)
establish necessary and sufficient conditions for mean square sense (mss) and
almost sure (a.s.) convergence of average consensus when network links fail;
and, in particular, (3) show that a necessary and sufficient condition for both
mss and a.s. convergence is for the algebraic connectivity of the mean graph
describing the network topology to be strictly positive. With these results, we
formulate topology design, subject to random link failures and to a
communication cost constraint, as a constrained convex optimization problem to
which we apply semidefinite programming techniques. We show by an extensive
numerical study that the optimal design improves significantly the convergence
speed of the consensus algorithm and can achieve the asymptotic performance of
a non-random network at a fraction of the communication cost.

November 2005. The BAT monitored it recurrently for a total of 2.7 Ms, and the
XRT and UVOT pointed it on seven occasions for a total of 67 ks, making it one
of the AGNs best monitored by Swift. The automatic optical and infrared
telescope REM has monitored simultaneously the source at all times. In
January-February 2005 PKS0537-441 has been detected at its brightest in optical
and X-rays: more than a factor of 2 brighter in X-rays and about a factor 60
brighter in the optical than observed in December 2004. The July 2005
observation recorded a fainter X-ray state. The simultaneous optical state,
monitored by both Swift UVOT and REM, is high, and in the VRI bands it is
comparable to what was recorded in early January 2005, before the outburst. In
November 2005, the source subsided both in X-rays and optical to a quiescent
state, having decreased by factors of ~4 and ~60 with respect to the
January-February 2005 outburst, respectively. Our monitoring shows an overall
well correlated optical and X-ray decay. On the shorter time scales (days or
hours), there is no obvious correlation between X-ray and optical variations,
but the former tend to be more pronounced, opposite to what is observed on
monthly time scales. The widely different amplitude of the long term
variability in optical and X-rays is very unusual and makes this observation a
unique case study for blazar activity. The spectral energy distributions are
interpreted in terms of the synchrotron and inverse Compton mechanisms within a
jet where the plasma radiates via internal shocks and the dissipation depends
on the distance of the emitting region from the central engine (abridged).

increase channel capacity and has a great potential to improve network capacity
for mesh networks. In a MIMO-based mesh network, the links outgoing from each
node sharing the common communication spectrum can be modeled as a Gaussian
vector broadcast channel. Recently, researchers showed that ``dirty paper
coding'' (DPC) is the optimal transmission strategy for Gaussian vector
broadcast channels. So far, there has been little study on how this fundamental
result will impact the cross-layer design for MIMO-based mesh networks. To fill
this gap, we consider the problem of jointly optimizing DPC power allocation in
the link layer at each node and multihop/multipath routing in a MIMO-based mesh
networks. It turns out that this optimization problem is a very challenging
non-convex problem. To address this difficulty, we transform the original
problem to an equivalent problem by exploiting the channel duality. For the
transformed problem, we develop an efficient solution procedure that integrates
Lagrangian dual decomposition method, conjugate gradient projection method
based on matrix differential calculus, cutting-plane method, and subgradient

planetary lensing follow-up observations, we investigate the variation of the
probability of detecting planetary signals depending on the observables of the

consider variation of the photometric precision by using a quantity defined as
the ratio of the fractional deviation of the planetary perturbation to the
photometric precision. From this investigation, we find consistent result from
previous studies that the probability increases with the increase of the
magnification. The increase rate is boosted at a certain magnification at which
perturbations caused by central caustic begin to occur. We find this boost
occurs at moderate magnifications of $A\lesssim 20$, implying that probability
can be high even for events with moderate magnifications. The probability
increases as the source brightness increases. We find that the probability of
events associated with stars brighter than clump giants is not negligible even
at magnifications as low as $A\sim 5$. In the absence of rare the prime target
of very high-magnification events, we, therefore, recommend to observe events
with brightest source stars and highest magnifications among the alerted
events. Due to the increase of the source size with the increase of the
brightness, however, the probability rapidly drops off beyond a certain
magnification, causing detections of low mass ratio planets ($q\lesssim
10^{-4}$) difficult from the observations of events involved with giant stars

protoplanetary discs. They have the potential to efficiently transport angular
momentum by MHD turbulence or via the magnetocentrifugal acceleration of
outflows from the disk surface, and magnetically-driven mixing has implications
for disk chemistry and evolution of the grain population. However, the weak
ionisation of protoplanetary discs means that magnetic fields may not be able
to effectively couple to the matter. I present calculations of the ionisation
equilibrium and magnetic diffusivity as a function of height from the disk
midplane at radii of 1 and 5 AU. Dust grains tend to suppress magnetic coupling
by soaking up electrons and ions from the gas phase and reducing the
conductivity of the gas by many orders of magnitude. However, once grains have
grown to a few microns in size their effect starts to wane and magnetic fields
can begin to couple to the gas even at the disk midplane. Because ions are
generally decoupled from the magnetic field by neutral collisions while
electrons are not, the Hall effect tends to dominate the diffusion of the
magnetic field when it is able to partially couple to the gas.
  For a standard population of 0.1 micron grains the active surface layers have
a combined column of about 2 g/cm^2 at 1 AU; by the time grains have aggregated
to 3 microns the active surface density is 80 g/cm^2. In the absence of grains,
x-rays maintain magnetic coupling to 10% of the disk material at 1 AU (150
g/cm^2). At 5 AU the entire disk thickness becomes active once grains have
aggregated to 1 micron in size.

clue to judge which scenario is favored. We calculated the fluxes of cosmogenic
neutrinos following these scenarios with plausible physical parameter sets, and
found several important features as follows. First of all, the neutrino flux at
$\sim 10^{20}$ eV becomes much higher in the ankle-transition scenario as long
as the maximum energy of the cosmic rays at sources is sufficiently high. On
the other hand, the neutrino spectrum has a characteristic peak at $\sim

protons significantly contribute to the observed cosmic rays down to $10^{17}$
eV. Thus, we conclude cosmogenic neutrinos should give us a clue to judge which

background coming from possible, powerful neutrino sources such as AGNs and
GRBs. We also found an interesting feature that the neutrino flux at $\sim
10^{18}$ eV depends only on the cosmological evolution of the cosmic ray
sources. That means cosmogenic neutrinos with the energy bring us information
on the cosmological evolution of the sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays.
Finally, we compare the fluxes of cosmogenic neutrinos with the expected
sensitivity curves of several neutrino detectors, and conclude the detection of
cosmogenic neutrinos in the near future is promising.

the daemon approach is analyzed considering the positive model independent
result of the DAMA/NaI experiment. We explain the maximum in DAMA signals
observed in the May-June period to be associated with the formation behind the
Sun of a trail of daemons that the Sun captures into elongated orbits as it
moves to the apex. The range of significant 2-6-keV DAMA signals fits well the
iodine nuclei elastically knocked out of the NaI(Tl) scintillator by particles
falling on the Earth with V=30-50 km/s from strongly elongated heliocentric
orbits. The half-year periodicity of the slower daemons observed in SPb
originates from the transfer of particles that are deflected through ~90 deg
into near-Earth orbits each time the particles cross the outer reaches of the
Sun which had captured them. Their multi-loop (cross-like) trajectories
traverse many times the Earth's orbit in March and September, which increases
the probability for the particles to enter near-Earth orbits during this time.
Corroboration of celestial mechanics calculations with observations yields
~1e-19 cm2 for the cross section of daemon interaction with the solar matter.

three families of Higgses and vector-like colour triplets. Our approach relies
on the Fayet-Iliopoulos breaking, and this is also a crucial ingredient,
together with having three Higgs families, to obtain in these models an
interesting pattern of fermion masses and mixing angles at the renormalizable
lebel. Namely, after the gauge breaking some physical particles appear combined
with other states, and the Yukawa couplings are modified in a well controlled
way. On the other hand, dangerous flavour-changing neutral currents may appear
when fermions of a given charge receive their mass through couplings with
several Higgs doublets. We will address this potential problem, finding that
viable scenarios can be obtained for a reasonable light Higgs spectrum.

active star formation but lacks a prominent near-infrared stellar cluster. We

evolutionary state of this region. Our observations include 1.3mm continuum and
spectral line data from the Submillimeter Array, VLA 3.6cm continuum and 1.3cm
water maser data, and multicolor IRAC images from the Spitzer Space Telescope.
The cometary morphology of the previously-known UCHII region G192.584-0.041 is
clearly revealed in our sensitive, multi-configuration 3.6cm images. The 1.3mm
continuum emission has been resolved into three compact cores, all of which are
dominated by dust emission and have radii < 7000AU. The mass estimates for
these cores range from 6 to 35 Msun. The centroid of the brightest dust core
(SMA1) is offset by 1.1'' (2800 AU) from the peak of the cometary UCHII region
and exhibits the strongest HC3N, CN, and DCN line emission in the region. SMA1
also exhibits compact CH3OH, SiO, and H2CO emission and likely contains a young
hot core. We find spatial and kinematic evidence that SMA1 may contain further
multiplicity, with one of the components coincident with a newly-detected H2O
maser. There are no mid-infrared point source counterparts to any of the dust
cores, further suggesting an early evolutionary phase for these objects. The
dominant mid-infrared emission is a diffuse, broadband component that traces
the surface of the cometary UCHII region but is obscured by foreground material
on its southern edge. An additional 4.5 micron linear feature emanating to the
northeast of SMA1 is aligned with a cluster of methanol masers and likely
traces a outflow from a protostar within SMA1. Our observations provide direct
evidence that S255N is forming a cluster of intermediate to high-mass stars.

the nanoparticles are driven to a non-equilibrium transformation, characterized

depends on the particle energy $E$ only. In the first part of the article, we
derive the first sufficient criterion for linear instability of $f_{0}(E):$
$f_{0}(E)$ is linearly unstable if the second-order operator \[
A_{0}\equiv-\Delta+4\pi\int f_{0}^{\prime}(E)\{I-\mathcal{P}\}dv \] has a
negative direction, where $\mathcal{P}$ is the projection onto the function
space $\{g(E,L)\},$ $L$ being the angular momentum [see the explicit formula

positivity leads to the nonlinear stability of the King model under all

La-based cuprates and based on the fermiology theories, we study the spin
susceptibility for La-based (e.g., La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$) and Y-based (e.g.,
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$) cuprates, respectively. The spin excitation in
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ is dominated by a sharp resonance peak at the frequency 40
meV in the superconducting state. Below and above the resonance frequency, the
incommensurate (IC) peaks develop and the intensity of the peaks decreases
dramatically. In the normal state, the resonant excitation does not occur and
the IC peaks are merged into commensurate ones. The spin excitation of
La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ is significantly different from that of Y-based ones,
namely, the resonance peak does not exist due to the decreasing of the
superconducting gap and the presence of the possible spin-stripe order. The
spectra are only enhanced at the expected resonance frequency (about 18 meV)
while it is still incommensurate. On the other hand, another frequency scale at
the frequency 55 meV is also revealed, namely the spectra are commensurate and
local maximum at this frequency. We elaborate all the results based on the
Fermi surface topology and the d-wave superconductivity, and suggest that the
spin-stripe order be also important in determining the spin excitation of
La-based cuprates. A coherent picture for the spin excitations is presented for
Y-based and La-based cuprates.

single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) have been studied quantitatively in the
range of dielectric constants from 1.0 to 37 by immersing SWNTs bridged over
trenches in various organic solvents by means of photoluminescence and the
excitation spectroscopies. With increasing environmental dielectric constant
($\epsilon_{\rm env}$), both $E_{11}$ and $E_{22}$ exhibited a redshift by
several tens meV and a tendency to saturate at a $\epsilon_{\rm env} \sim 5$
without an indication of significant ($n$,$m$) dependence. The redshifts can be
explained by dielectric screening of the repulsive electron-electron
interaction. The $\epsilon_{\rm env}$ dependence of $E_{11}$ and $E_{22}$ can
be expressed by a simple empirical equation with a power law in $\epsilon_{\rm
env}$, $E_{\rm ii} = E_{\rm ii}^{\infty} + A\epsilon_{\rm env}^{-\alpha}$. We
also immersed a sample in sodium-dodecyl-sulfate (SDS) solution to investigate
the effects of wrapping SWNTs with surfactant. The resultant $E_{11}$ and
$E_{22}$, which agree well with Weisman's data [Nano Lett. {\bf 3}, 1235

to the shift due to dielectric screening, another shift was observed so that

partial monitoring. Given a weighted directed acyclic graph whose edge weights
can change in an arbitrary (adversarial) way, a decision maker has to choose in
each round of a game a path between two distinguished vertices such that the
loss of the chosen path (defined as the sum of the weights of its composing
edges) be as small as possible. In a setting generalizing the multi-armed
bandit problem, after choosing a path, the decision maker learns only the
weights of those edges that belong to the chosen path. For this problem, an
algorithm is given whose average cumulative loss in n rounds exceeds that of
the best path, matched off-line to the entire sequence of the edge weights, by
a quantity that is proportional to 1/\sqrt{n} and depends only polynomially on
the number of edges of the graph. The algorithm can be implemented with linear
complexity in the number of rounds n and in the number of edges. An extension
to the so-called label efficient setting is also given, in which the decision
maker is informed about the weights of the edges corresponding to the chosen
path at a total of m << n time instances. Another extension is shown where the
decision maker competes against a time-varying path, a generalization of the
problem of tracking the best expert. A version of the multi-armed bandit
setting for shortest path is also discussed where the decision maker learns
only the total weight of the chosen path but not the weights of the individual
edges on the path. Applications to routing in packet switched networks along
with simulation results are also presented.

discussed, including a general result for large N. The partition function for
BPS operators in the chiral ring of \N=4 super Yang Mills is analysed in terms
of plane partitions. Asymptotic counting of BPS primary operators with

acting between two dielectrics, dielectric and metal, and between metal and
semiconductor. The detailed derivation for the low-temperature behavior of the
Casimir free energy, pressure and entropy in the configuration of two real
dielectric plates is presented. For dielectrics with finite static dielectric
permittivity it is shown that the Nernst heat theorem is satisfied. Hence, the
Lifshitz theory of the van der Waals and Casimir forces is demonstrated to be
consistent with thermodynamics. The nonzero dc conductivity of dielectric
plates is proved to lead to a violation of the Nernst heat theorem and, thus,
is not related to the phenomenon of dispersion forces. The low-temperature
asymptotics of the Casimir free energy, pressure and entropy are derived also
in the configuration of one metal and one dielectric plate. The results are
shown to be consistent with thermodynamics if the dielectric plate possesses a
finite static dielectric permittivity. If the dc conductivity of a dielectric
plate is taken into account this results in the violation of the Nernst heat
theorem. We discuss both the experimental and theoretical results related to
the Casimir interaction between metal and semiconductor with different charge
carrier density. Discussions in the literature on the possible influence of
spatial dispersion on the thermal Casimir force are analyzed. In conclusion,
the conventional Lifshitz theory taking into account only the frequency
dispersion remains the reliable foundation for the interpretation of all
present experiments.

shortest program producing s is its noncomputability which limits its range of
applicability. Moreover, when strings are short, the dependence of K on a
particular universal Turing machine U can be arbitrary. In practice one can
approximate it by computable compression methods. However, such compression
methods do not always provide meaningful approximations--for strings shorter,
for example, than typical compiler lengths. In this paper we suggest an
empirical approach to overcome this difficulty and to obtain a stable
definition of the Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity for short sequences.
Additionally, a correlation in terms of distribution frequencies was found
across the output of two models of abstract machines, namely unidimensional
cellular automata and deterministic Turing machine.

0704.1044,The redshift and geometrical aspect of photons,"11 pages, 1 figure",,,,['physics.gen-ph'],,"  The cosmological redshift phenomenon can be described by the dark matter
field fluid model, the results deduced from this model agree very well with the
observations. The observed cosmological redshift of light depends on both the
speed of the emitter and the distance between the emitter and the observer. If
the emitter moves away from us, a redshift is observed. If the emitter moves
towards us, whether a redshift, a blueshift or no shift is observed will depend
on the speed vs. the distance. If the speed is in the range of
c(exp[-beta*D]-1) < v < 0, a redshift is observed; if the speed equals
c(exp[-beta*D]-1), no shift is observed; if the speed v less than
c(exp[-beta*D]-1), a blueshift is observed. A redshift will be always observed
in all directions for any celestial objects as long as their distance from us
is large enough. Therefore, many more redshifts than blueshifts should be
observed for galaxies and supernovae, etc in the sky. This conclusion agrees
with current observations. The estimated value of the redshift constant beta of
the dark matter field fluid is in the range of 10^(-3) ~ 10^(-5)/Mpc. A large
redshift value from a distant celestial object may not necessarily indicate
that it has a large receding speed. Based on the redshift effect of dark matter
field fluid, it is concluded that at least in time average all photons have the
same geometry (size and shape) in all inertial reference frames and do not have
length contraction effect.

At the cool stars 14 meeting, a splinter session was convened to discuss the
role of environment in the formation of cool stars and planetary systems; with
an emphasis on the ``hot'' environment found in rich clusters. We review here
the basic results, ideas and questions presented at the session. We have

of the Sun? The intention is to review progress made in addressing each

factorization approach. The nonresonant contributions arising from $B\to
P_1P_2$ transitions are evaluated using heavy meson chiral perturbation theory
(HMChPT). The momentum dependence of nonresonant amplitudes is assumed to be in
the exponential form $e^{-\alpha_{NR}} p_B\cdot(p_i+p_j)}$ so that the HMChPT
results are recovered in the soft meson limit $p_i, p_j\to 0$. In addition, we
have identified another large source of the nonresonant signal in the matrix
elements of scalar densities, e.g. $<K\bar K|\bar ss|0>$, which can be
constrained from the decay $\bar B^0\to K_SK_SK_S$ or $B^-\to K^-K_SK_S$. The
intermediate vector meson contributions to 3-body decays are identified through
the vector current, while the scalar meson resonances are mainly associated
with the scalar density. Their effects are described in terms of the
Breit-Wigner formalism. Our main results are: (i) All KKK modes are dominated
by the nonresonant background. The predicted branching ratios of
$K^+K^-K_{S(L)}$, $K^+K^-K^-$ and $K^-K_SK_S$ modes are consistent with the
data within errors. (ii) Although the penguin-dominated $B^0\to K^+K^-K_{S}$
decay is subject to a potentially significant tree pollution, its effective
$\sin 2\beta$ is very similar to that of the $K_SK_SK_S$ mode. However, direct
CP asymmetry of the former, being of order -4%, is more prominent than the
latter. (iii) For $B\to K\pi\pi$ decays, we found sizable nonresonant
contributions in $K^-\pi^+\pi^-$ and $\bar K^0\pi^+\pi^-$ modes, in agreement

crossover. A number of characteristics of purely quantum nature are found: The
in-plane interaction s_i^x s_j^x + s_i^y s_j^y induces an antiferromagnetic

cases of standard mixed formulations of symmetric problems with large jumps in
coefficients. We prove that they are well-posed in a standard norm despite the
degeneracy. By wellposedness we mean a stable dependence of the solution on the
right-hand side. A known approach of splitting the saddle point problem into
separate equations for the primary unknown and for the Lagrange multiplier is
used. We revisit the traditional Ladygenskaya--Babu\v{s}ka--Brezzi (LBB) or
inf--sup condition as well as the standard coercivity condition, and analyze
how they are affected by the degeneracy of the corresponding bilinear forms. We
suggest and discuss generalized conditions that cover the degenerate case. The
LBB or inf--sup condition is necessary and sufficient for wellposedness of the
problem with respect to the Lagrange multiplier under some assumptions. The
generalized coercivity condition is necessary and sufficient for wellposedness
of the problem with respect to the primary unknown under some other
assumptions. We connect the generalized coercivity condition to the
positiveness of the minimum gap of relevant subspaces, and propose several
equivalent expressions for the minimum gap. Our results provide a foundation
for research on uniform wellposedness of mixed formulations of symmetric
problems with large jumps in coefficients in a standard norm, independent of
the jumps. Such problems appear, e.g., in numerical simulations of composite
materials made of components with contrasting properties.

0704.1067,Expected Planets in Globular Clusters,Accepted by MNRAS,,10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.12272.x,,['astro-ph'],,"  We argue that all transient searches for planets in globular clusters have a
very low detection probability. Planets of low metallicity stars typically do
not reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system
properties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is
considered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,
respectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems
at high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,
where M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is
only at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it
is still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular
clusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at
orbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on
the role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in
globular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch
stars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in
forming low mass white dwarfs.

instantons on general type II orientifold compactifications, and show that only
instantons with O(1) symmetry can have just the two zero modes required to
contribute to the 4d superpotential. We however discuss how the addition of
fluxes and/or possible non-perturbative extensions of the orientifold
compactifications would allow also instantons with $Sp(2)$ and U(1) symmetries
to generate such superpotentials. In the context of Gepner orientifolds with
MSSM-like spectra, we find no models with O(1) instantons with just the
required zero modes to generate a neutrino mass superpotential. On the other
hand we find a number of models in one particular orientifold of the Gepner
model $(2,4,22,22)$ with $Sp(2)$ instantons with a few extra uncharged
non-chiral zero modes which could be easily lifted by the mentioned effects. A
few more orientifold examples are also found under less stringent constraints
on the zero modes. This class of $Sp(2)$ instantons have the interesting
property that R-parity conservation is automatic and the flavour structure of
the neutrino Majorana mass matrices has a simple factorized form.

variety of fixed points and no cyclic orbit. The family of fixed points
includes Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions. In one-dimensional field
theories pseudoperiodic and quasiperiodic boundary conditions are also RG fixed
points. Under these conditions massless bosonic free field theories are
conformally invariant. Among all fixed points only Neumann boundary conditions
are infrared stable fixed points. All other conformal invariant boundary
conditions become unstable under some relevant perturbations. In finite volumes
we analyse the dependence of the vacuum energy along the trajectories of the

evolution. On the contrary, the renormalization group flow on the boundary does

based on using in matched filtering only the dominant harmonic of the inspiral

More significantly, inclusion of other harmonics in our matched filters would
mean that more massive systems that were previously thought to be {\it not}
visible in LISA should be detectable with reasonable SNRs. Our estimates show
that we should be able to significantly increase the mass reach of LISA and
observe the more commonly occurring supermassive black holes of masses $\sim

will be able to observe even supermassive black hole coalescences with total

cut-off of $10^{-4}{\rm Hz}$ $(10^{-5}{\rm Hz})$ with an SNR up to $\sim 60$

the Laplace expansion of the Coulomb potential which possesses a characteristic
two-range form. Guseinov [Chem. Phys. {\bf 309}, 209 - 213 (2005)] derived
one-range addition theorems for the Coulomb potential via the limit $\beta \to
0$ in previously derived one-range addition theorems for the Yukawa potential
$\exp \bigl(-\beta | \bm{r}-\bm{r}'| \bigr) /| \bm{r}-\bm{r}'|$. At first
sight, this looks like a remarkable achievement, but from a mathematical point
of view, Guseinov's work is at best questionable and in some cases
fundamentally flawed. One-range addition theorems are expansions in terms of
functions that are complete and orthonormal in a given Hilbert space, but
Guseinov replaced the complete and orthonormal functions by nonorthogonal
Slater-type functions and rearranged the resulting expansions. This is a
dangerous operation whose validity must be checked. It is shown that the
one-center limit $\bm{r}' = \bm{0}$ of Guseinov's rearranged Yukawa addition
theorems as well as of several other addition theorems does not exist.
Moreover, the Coulomb potential does not belong to any of the Hilbert spaces
implicitly used by Guseinov. Accordingly, one-range addition theorems for the
Coulomb potential diverge in the mean. Instead, these one-range addition
theorems have to interpreted as expansions of generalized functions in the
sense of Schwartz that converge weakly in suitable functionals.

eastern side of Tycho's supernova remnant using the Subaru Telescope. Utilizing
the High Dispersion Spectrograph (HDS), we measure the spatial variation of the
line profile between preshock and postshock gas. Our observation clearly shows
a broadening and centroid shift of the narrow-component postshock Ha line
relative to the Ha emission from the preshock gas. The observation supports the
existence of a thin precursor where gas is heated and accelerated ahead of the
shock. Furthermore, the spatial profile of the emission ahead of the Balmer
filament shows a gradual gradient in the Ha intensity and line width ahead of
the shock. We propose that this region (~10^16 cm) is likely to be the
spatially resolved precursor. The line width increases from ~30 up to ~45 km/s,
and its central velocity shows a redshift of ~5 km/s across the shock front.
The characteristics of the precursor are consistent with a cosmic-ray
precursor, although the possibility of a fast neutral precursor is not ruled
out.

consider the problem of description of polynomial hulls $\wh{Gv}$ for orbits
$Gv$, $v\in V$, assuming that the identity component of $G$ is a torus $T$. The
paper contains a universal construction for orbits which satisfy the inclusion
$Gv\subset T^\bbC v$ and a characterization of pairs $(G,V)$ such that it is
true for a generic $v\in V$. The hull of a finite union of $T$-orbits in
$T^\bbC v$ can be distinguished in $\clos T^\bbC v$ by a finite collection of
inequalities of the type $\abs{z_1}^{s_1}...\abs{z_n}^{s_n}\leq c$. In
particular, this is true for $Gv$. If powers in the monomials are independent
of $v$, $Gv\subset T^\bbC v$ for a generic $v$, and either the center of $G$ is
finite or $T^\bbC$ has an open orbit, then the space $V$ and the group $G$ are
products of standard ones; the latter means that $G=S_nT$, where $S_n$ is the
group of all permutations of coordinates and $T$ is either $\bbT^n$ or
$\SU(n)\cap\bbT^n$, where $\bbT^n$ is the torus of all diagonal matrices in
$\rU(n)$. The paper also contains a description of polynomial hulls for orbits
of isotropy groups of bounded symmetric domains. This result is already known,

scaling analysis we determine this critical exponent and the thermally
activated behavior of the linear resistivity. The results are in agreement with
earlier calculations using the resistively shunted-junction model for the

$qq$ forces) to the analytical structure of the $qqq$ wave function is worked
out in the high momentum regime of QCD where the confining interaction may be
ignored, so that the dominant effect is $Coulombic$. A distinctive feature of
this study is that the spin-rich $qqq$ force is generated by a $ggg$ vertex (a
genuine part of the QCD Lagrangian) wherein the 3 radiating gluon lines end on
as many quark lines, giving rise to a (Mercedes-Benz type) $Y$-shaped diagram.
The dynamics is that of a Salpeter-like equation (3D support for the kernel)
formulated covariantly on the light front, a la Markov-Yukawa Transversality
Principle (MYTP) which warrants a 2-way interconnection between the 3D and 4D
Bethe-Salpeter (BSE) forms for 2 as well as 3 fermion quarks. With these
ingredients, the differential equation for the 3D wave function $\phi$ receives
well-defined contributions from the $qq$ and $qqq$ forces. In particular a
$negative$ eigenvalue of the spin operator $i \sigma_1.\sigma_2\times \sigma_3$
which is an integral part of the $qqq$ force, causes a characteristic
singularity in the differential equation, signalling the dynamical effect of a
spin-rich $qqq$ force not yet considered in the literature. The potentially
crucial role of this interesting effect vis-a-vis the so-called `spin anomaly'
of the proton, is a subject of considerable physical interest.

a disk blackbody) to ascertain the dependence of estimated parameters on the
spectral model used. It was found that the cumulative luminosity function
depends on the choice of the spectral model, especially for luminosities $>
10^{40}$ ergs/s. In accordance with previous results, a large number ($\sim
80$) of the sources have luminosities $> 10^{39}$ ergs/s (Ultra-Luminous X-ray
sources) with indistinguishable average spectral parameters (inner disk
temperature $\sim 1$ keV and/or photon index $\Gamma \sim 2$) with those of the
lower luminosities ones. After considering foreground stars and known
background AGN,we identify four sources whose minimum luminosity exceed
$10^{40}$ ergs/s, and call them Extremely Luminous X-ray sources (ELX). The
spectra of these sources are in general better represented by the disk black
body model than the power-law one. These ELX can be grouped into two distinct
spectral classes. Two of them have an inner disk temperature of $< 0.5$ keV and
hence are called ``supersoft'' ELX, while the other two have temperatures
$\gtrsim 1.3$ keV and are called ``hard'' ELX. The estimated inner disk
temperatures of the supersoft ELX are compatible with the hypothesis that they
harbor intermediate size black holes, which are accreting at $\sim 0.5$ times

rounded appearance. In the other two objects, it consists of two spatial
components. The three nebulae are aligned with the radio axis within <30 deg.
The total Ly-alpha luminosities are in the range (0.3-3.4) x 1e44 erg s-1. The
Ly-alpha spectral profile shows strong variation through the nebulae, with FWHM
values in the range ~400-1500 km s-1 and velocity shifts V~120-600 km s-1.
  We present an infall model which can explain successfully most Ly-alpha
morphological and spectroscopic properties of the nebula associated with MRC
1558-003. This adds further support to our previous conclusion that the
_quiescent_ giant nebulae associated with this and other high redshift powerful
radio galaxies are in infall. A problem for this model is the difficulty to
reproduce the large Ly-alpha FWHM values.
  We have discovered a giant (~85 kpc) Ly-alpha nebula associated with the
radio galaxy MRC 0140-257 at z=2.64. It shows strikingly relaxed kinematics
(FWHM< 300 km s-1 and V<120 km s-1), unique among high z (>2) radio galaxies.

nonhomogeneous solutions of the field equations, in phase transitions
associated to spontaneous symmetry breaking in gauge theories, whose study is
of importance in phase transitions in the early universe, for instance. Here we
show a derivation of a model dual to the scalar Abelian Higgs model where its
topological excitations, namely vortex-strings, become manifest and can be

analytically using the theory of Markov Chains and by numerical simulations in

non-optimizing agents. In other words, low-entropy (more informative)

applied magnetic field, has been shown to exhibit a nonequilibrium,
second-order dynamic phase transition (DPT), whose order parameter Q is the
period-averaged magnetization. It has been established that this DPT falls in
the same universality class as the equilibrium phase transition in the
two-dimensional Ising model in zero applied field. Here we study for the first
time the scaling of the dynamic order parameter with respect to a nonzero,
period-averaged, magnetic `bias' field, H_b, for a DPT produced by a
square-wave applied field. We find evidence that the scaling exponent,
\delta_d, of H_b at the critical period of the DPT is equal to the exponent for
the critical isotherm, \delta_e, in the equilibrium Ising model. This implies
that H_b is a significant component of the field conjugate to Q. A finite-size
scaling analysis of the dynamic order parameter above the critical period
provides further support for this result. We also demonstrate numerically that,
for a range of periods and values of H_b in the critical region, a
fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR), with an effective temperature
T_{eff}(T, P, H_0) depending on the period, and possibly the temperature and
field amplitude, holds for the variables Q and H_b. This FDR justifies the use
of the scaled variance of Q as a proxy for the nonequilibrium susceptibility,
\partial<Q> / \partial H_b, in the critical region.

(HI) emission morphology and small-scale structure observed by the Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) in an area bounded by l = 60 & 180 deg, b =
30 & 70 deg, which was the primary target for this study. This area is marked
by the presence of highly disturbed local HI and a preponderance of
intermediate- and high-velocity gas. The HI distribution toward the brightest
peaks in the WMAP Internal Linear Combination (ILC) map for this area is
examined and by comparing with a second area on the sky it is demonstrated that
the associations do not appear to be the result of chance coincidence. Close
examination of several of the associations reveals important new properties of
diffuse interstellar neutral hydrogen structure. In the case of high-velocity
cloud MI, the HI and WMAP ILC morphologies are similar and an excess of soft
X-ray emission and H-alpha emission have been reported for this feature. It is
suggested that the small angular-scale, high frequency continuum emission
observed by WMAP may be produced at the surfaces of HI features interacting one
another, or at the interface between moving HI structures and regions of
enhanced plasma density in the surrounding interstellar medium. It is possible
that dust grains play a role in producing the emission. However, the primary

coronal holes is investigated. We employ an analytical 2-D model of the large
scale coronal magnetic field that provides a good representation of the corona
at the minimum of solar activity. We use the mass-flux conservation equation to
determine the outflow speed of the solar wind at any location in the solar
corona and take into account the integration along the line of sight (LOS). The
main assumption we make is that no anisotropy in the kinetic temperature of the
coronal species is considered. We find that at distances greater than 1 Rsun
from the solar surface the widths of the emitted lines of O VI and Mg X are
sensitive to the details of the adopted electron density stratification.
However, Ly-$\alpha$, which is a pure radiative line, is hardly affected. The
calculated total intensities of Ly-$\alpha$ and the O VI doublet depend to a
lesser degree on the density stratification and are comparable to the observed
ones for most of the considered density models. The widths of the observed
profiles of Ly-$\alpha$ and Mg X are well reproduced by most of the considered
electron density stratifications, while for the O VI doublet only few
stratifications give satisfying results. The densities deduced from SOHO data
result in O VI profiles whose widths and intensity ratio are relatively close
to the values observed by UVCS although only isotropic velocity distributions
are employed. These density profiles also reproduce the other considered
observables with good accuracy. Thus the need for a strong anisotropy of the
velocity distribution (i.e. a temperature anisotropy) is not so clear cut as

0805+3822) is also presented. Radial velocity studies provided an orbital
period of 3.55 h for HS 1813+6122, which allowed us to identify the observed
photometric signal at 3.39 h as a negative superhump wave. The spectroscopic
behaviour clearly identifies these new CVs as new SW Sextantis stars. These new
additions increase the number of known SW Sex stars to 35. Almost 40 per cent
of the total SW Sex population do not show eclipses, invalidating the
requirement of eclipses as a defining characteristic of the class and the
models based on a high orbital inclination geometry alone. On the other hand,
the predominance of orbital periods in the narrow 3-4.5 h range is becoming
more pronounced. In fact, almost half the CVs which populate the 3-4.5 h period
interval are definite members of the class. These statistics are confirmed by
our results from the Hamburg Quasar Survey CVs. Remarkably, 54 per cent of the
Hamburg nova-like variables have been identified as SW Sex stars with orbital
periods in the 3-4.5 h range. The observation of this pile-up of systems close
to the upper boundary of the period gap is difficult to reconcile with the
standard theory of CV evolution, as the SW Sex stars are believed to have the
highest mass transfer rates among CVs. Finally, we review the full range of
common properties that the SW Sex stars exhibit.

Two detailed examples illustrate that stability conditions can put strong

the stability of the smectic phase may be greatly enhanced, and that this
effect can be rationalised in terms of depletion forces. In the present paper
we first study the effect of orientational order on depletion forces in this
particular binary system, comparing our results with those obtained adopting
the usual approximation of considering the rods parallel and their orientations
frozen. We consider mixtures with rods of different aspect ratios and spheres
of different diameters, and we treat them within Onsager theory. Our results
indicate that depletion effects, and consequently smectic stability, decrease
significantly as a result of orientational disorder in the smectic phase when
compared with corresponding data based on the frozen--orientation
approximation. These results are discussed in terms of the $\tau$ parameter,
which has been proposed as a convenient measure of depletion strength. We
present closed expressions for $\tau$, and show that it is intimately connected
with the depletion potential. We then analyse the effect of particle geometry
by comparing results pertaining to systems of parallel rods of different shapes
(spherocylinders, cylinders and parallelepipeds). We finally provide results
based on the Zwanzig approximation of a Fundamental--Measure
density--functional theory applied to mixtures of parallelepipeds and cubes of
different sizes. In this case, we show that the $\tau$ parameter exhibits a
linear asymptotic behaviour in the limit of large values of the hard--rod
aspect ratio, in conformity with Onsager theory, as well as in the limit of
large values of the ratio of rod breadth to cube side length, $d$, in contrast
to Onsager approximation, which predicts $\tau\sim d^3$.

the rare B-decays b -> s gamma and B_u -> tau nu and the experimental limit on

non-standard Higgs searches at hadron colliders less promising. On the contrary
these bounds are relaxed for small values of A_t and large values of the

phase contains black hole-like objects. These so-called ``plasma puddles'' are
meta-stable lumps of hot plasma lying in locally un-Higgsed regions of space.
They decay via O(1/N) thermal radiation and, perhaps surprisingly, absorb all
incident matter. We show that an incident particle of energy E striking the
plasma puddle will shower into an enormous number of decay products whose
multiplicity grows linearly with E, and whose average energy is independent of
E. Once these ultra-soft particles reach the interior they are thermalized by
the plasma within, and so the object appears ``black.'' We determine some gross
properties like the size and temperature of the the plasma puddle in terms of
fundamental parameters in the gauge theory. Interestingly, demanding that the
plasma puddle emit thermal Hawking radiation implies that the object is black
(i.e. absorbs all incident particles), which implies classical stability, which
implies satisfaction of the Bekenstein entropy bound. Because of the AdS/CFT
duality and the many similarities between plasma puddles and black holes, we
conjecture that black objects are a robust feature of quantum gravity.

extended systems is first carried out in the context of a simplified scalar
model, for which stationary patterns can be found analytically. We first show
how system-size stochastic resonance arises naturally in this framework, and
then how the phenomenon of array-enhanced stochastic resonance can be further
enhanced by letting the diffusion coefficient depend on the field. A yet less
trivial generalization is exemplified by a stylized version of the
FitzHugh-Nagumo system, a paradigm of the activator-inhibitor class. After
discussing for this system the second aspect enumerated above, we derive from
it -through an adiabatic-like elimination of the inhibitor field- an effective
scalar model that includes a nonlocal contribution. Studying the role played by
the range of the nonlocal kernel and its effect on stochastic resonance, we
find an optimal range that maximizes the system's response.

the leading edge of the GW signal is redshifted more than the inner boundary of

GW pulses from the final plunge of black hole (BH) binaries, leading to the
evolution of the GW profile as a function of the radial distance from the
source. The distortion depends on the total GW energy released and the duration
of the emission, scaled by the total binary mass, M. The effect should be
relevant in finite box simulations where the waveforms are extracted within a
radius of <~ 100M. For characteristic emission parameters at the final plunge
between binary BHs of arbitrary spins, this effect could distort the simulated
GW templates for LIGO and LISA by a fraction of 0.001. Accounting for the wave

~1 and ~4 degrees from the center of the galaxy, are situated in different
parts of the SMC such as the ""Wing'' area, and towards the West and South. In
this paper we perform a first analysis of the stellar content in our SMC fields
through comparison with theoretical isochrones and color functions (CFs). We
find that the underlying spheroidally distributed population is composed of
both intermediate-age and old stars and that its age composition does not show
strong galacto-centric gradients. The three fields situated toward the east, in
the Wing region, show very active current star formation. However, only in the
eastern field closest to the center do we find an enhancement of recent star
formation with respect to a constant SFR(t). The fields corresponding to the
western side of the SMC present a much less populated young MS, and the CF
analysis indicates that the SFR(t) greatly diminished around 2 Gyr ago in these
parts. Field smc0057, the closest to the center of the galaxy and located in
the southern part, shows recent star formation, while the rest of the southern
fields present few bright MS stars. The structure of the red clump in all the
CMDs is consistent with the large amount of intermediate-age stars inferred
from the CMDs and color functions. None of the SMC fields presented here are
dominated by old stellar populations, a fact that is in agreement with the lack
of a conspicuous horizontal branch in all these SMC CMDs. This could indicate
that a disk population is ruling over a possible old halo in all the observed

potential scientific and technological interest of this phenomenon calls for a
study of the effects of the noises' statistics and spectrum. This task is
facilitated if these noises are dynamically generated by means of stochastic
differential equations (SDE) driven by white noises. One such case is that of
Ornstein--Uhlenbeck noises which are stationary, with Gaussian pdf and a
variance reduced by the self-correlation time (\tau), and whose effect on the
NIPT phase diagram has been studied some time ago. Another such case is when
the stationary pdf is a (colored) Tsallis' (q)--\emph{Gaussian} which, being a
\emph{fat-tail} distribution for (q>1) and a \emph{compact-support} one for
(q<1), allows for a controlled exploration of the effects of the departure from
Gaussian statistics. As done before with stochastic resonance and other
phenomena, we now exploit this tool to study--within a simple mean-field

excess in the spectrum of the nucleus at wavelengths longer than 25 um, which

we present a systematic method for studying these objects that provides a view
of their properties and allows their characterization. Eighteen remnant
candidates are analyzed by means of photometric and proper motion data. These
data provide information on objects and their fields. We establish criteria for
characterizing open cluster remnants, taking observational uncertainties into
account. 2MASS J and H photometry is employed (i) to study structural
properties of the objects by means of radial stellar density profiles, (ii) to
test for any similarity between objects and fields with a statistical
comparison method applied to the distributions of stars in the CMDs, and (iii)
to obtain ages, reddening values, and distances from the CMD, taking an index
of isochrone fit into account. The UCAC2 proper motions allowed an objective
comparison between objects and large solid angle offset fields. The objective
analysis based on the present methods indicates 13 open-cluster remnants in the
sample. Evidence of the presence of binary stars is found, as expected for
dynamically evolved systems. Finally, we infer possible evolutionary stages
among remnants from the structure, proper motion, and CMD distributions. The
low stellar statistics for individual objects is overcome by means of the
construction of composite proper motion and CMD diagrams. The distributions of
remnants in the composite diagrams resemble the single-star and unresolved

La1.95Sr0.05CuO4 scales to a similar finite value as at optimal doping,
strongly suggesting that they are similarly distant from a quantum critical

established early in their evolution. The mechanism behind this remains
unresolved. Recent results suggest that massive protostars may capture
companions through disk interactions with much higher efficiency than their
solar mass counterparts. However, this conclusion is based on analytic
determinations of capture rates and estimates of the robustness of the
resulting binaries. We present the results of coupled n-body and SPH
simulations of star-disk encounters to further test the idea that disk-captured
binaries contribute to the observed multiplicity of massive stars.

describing a self-synchronizing phase transition in a system of globally
coupled oscillators that in general have different characteristic frequencies.
The reformulated model provides an alternative coherent framework through which
one can analytically tackle synchronization problems that are not amenable to
the original Kuramoto analysis. It allows one to solve explicitly for the
synchronization order parameter and the critical point of 1) the full
phase-locking transition for a system with a finite number of oscillators
(unlike the original Kuramoto model, which is solvable implicitly only in the
mean-field limit) and 2) a new class of continuum systems. It also makes it
possible to probe the system's dynamics as it moves towards a steady state.
While discussion in this paper is restricted to systems with global coupling,
the new formalism introduced by the linear reformulation also lends itself to
solving systems that exhibit local or asymmetric coupling.

$\lambda + \sum_{k = 1}^d [\prod_{j = 1}^k L_{kj}]$, where $L_{kj}$'s are
linear forms in $x, y$ and $z$ and $\lambda$ is a real number. The coefficients
of these linear forms, viewed as 3D vectors, are called \emph{multipole}
vectors of $P$. In this paper we consider similar multipole representations of
polynomial and analytic functions on other quadratic surfaces $Q(x, y, z) = c$,
real and complex. Over the complex numbers, the above representation is not
unique, although the ambiguity is essentially finite. We investigate the
combinatorics that depicts this ambiguity. We link these results with some
classical theorems of harmonic analysis, theorems that describe decompositions
of functions into sums of spherical harmonics. We extend these classical
theorems (which rely on our understanding of the Laplace operator
$\Delta_{S^2}$) to more general differential operators $\Delta_Q$ that are
constructed with the help of the quadratic form $Q(x, y, z)$. Then we introduce
modular spaces of multipoles. We study their intricate geometry and topology
using methods of algebraic geometry and singularity theory. The multipole
spaces are ramified over vector or projective spaces, and the compliments to
the ramification sets give rise to a rich family of $K(\pi, 1)$-spaces, where

sample into 158 metal-rich ([Fe/H] > -1.0) and 178 metal-poor ([Fe/H] < -1.0)
globular clusters. Our results show the kinematics of the metal-rich and
metal-poor subpopulations are quite similar. The kinematics are compared to the
planetary nebula population where differences are apparent in the outer regions
of the halo. The total mass of NGC 5128 is found using the Tracer Mass
estimator (Evans et al. 2003), to determine the mass supported by internal
random motions, and the spherical component of the Jeans equation to determine
the mass supported by rotation. We find a total mass of (1.0+/-0.2) x 10^(12)
Msun from the planetary nebulae data out to a projected radius of 90 kpc and
(1.3+/-0.5) x 10^(12) Msun from the globular clusters out to a projected radius

clusters in NGC 5128. This catalog combines all previous definitive cluster
identifications from radial velocity studies and HST imaging studies, as well
as 80 new globular clusters from a study of M.A. Beasley et al. (2007, in

stars. Four of these stars were first observed as part of the N2K program and
exhibited low RMS velocity scatter after three consecutive observations.
However, follow-up observations over the last three years now reveal the
presence of longer period planets with orbital periods ranging from 21 days to
a few years. HD 11506 is a G0V star with a planet of \msini = 4.74 \mjup in a
3.85 year orbit. HD 17156 is a G0V star with a 3.12 \mjup planet in a 21.2 day
orbit. The eccentricity of this orbit is 0.67, one of the highest known for a
planet with a relatively short period. The orbital period for this planet
places it in a region of parameter space where relatively few planets have been
detected. HD 125612 is a G3V star with a planet of \msini = 3.5 \mjup in a 1.4
year orbit. HD 170469 is a G5IV star with a planet of \msini = 0.67 \mjup in a
3.13 year orbit. HD 231701 is an F8V star with planet of 1.08 \mjup in a 142
day orbit. All of these stars have supersolar metallicity. Three of the five
stars were observed photometrically but showed no evidence of brightness
variability. A transit search conducted for HD 17156 was negative but covered
only 25% of the search space and so is not conclusive.

Synthesis Radio Telescope operated in a tied-array mode at a frequency of 1200
MHz. The PuMa pulsar backend provided voltage recording of X and Y linear
polarization states in two conjugate 10 MHz bands. We restricted the time
resolution to 4 microseconds to match the scattering on the interstellar
inhomogeneities. In total about 18000 giant pulses (GP) were detected in full
intensity with a threshold level of 6 sigma. Cumulative probability
distributions (CPD) of giant pulse energies were analyzed for groups of GPs
with different effective widths in the range 4 to 65 microseconds. The CPDs
were found to manifest notable differences for the different GP width groups.
The slope of a power-law fit to the high-energy portion of the CPDs evolves
from -1.7 to -3.2 when going from the shortest to the longest GPs. There are
breaks in the CPD power-law fits indicating flattening at low energies with
indices varying from -1.0 to -1.9 for the short and long GPs respectively. The
GPs with a stronger peak flux density were found to be of shorter duration. We
compare our results with previously published data and discuss the importance

very useful for exploring the stellar populations of distant galaxies. In
detail, colour pairs [(r-K), (u-R)] and [(r-K), (u-r)] are shown to be the best
pairs for estimating stellar ages and metallicities. They can constrain two
stellar-population parameters on average with age uncertainties less than 3.89
Gyr and metallicity uncertainties less than 0.34 dex for typical uncertainties
in colours. Some other colour pairs, such as [(R-K), (u-R)], [(I-K), (u-R)],
[(R-K), (u-r)] and [(i-J), (u-R)], can possibly be used for constraining the
two parameters, too. As a whole, our results suggest that colours relating to
both UBVRIJHK and ugriz magnitudes are much better than either UBVRIJHK colours
or ugriz colours for breaking the well-known degeneracy. The results also show
that the stellar ages and metallicities of galaxies observed by the Sloan

Saturn prevented Type II migration from driving these planets much closer to
the Sun. Our work extends previous results by Masset and Snellgrove (2001), by
exploring a wider set of initial conditions and disk parameters, and by using a
new hydrodynamical code that properly describes for the global viscous
evolution of the disk. Initially both planets migrate towards the Sun, and
Saturn's migration tends to be faster. As a consequence, they eventually end up
locked in a mean motion resonance. If this happens in the 2:3 resonance, the
resonant motion is particularly stable, and the gaps opened by the planets in
the disk may overlap. This causes a drastic change in the torque balance for
the two planets, which substantially slows down the planets' inward migration.
If the gap overlap is substantial, planet migration may even be stopped or
reversed. As the widths of the gaps depend on disk viscosity and scale height,
this mechanism is particularly efficient in low viscosity, cool disks. We
discuss the compatibility of our results with the initial conditions adopted in
Tsiganis et al. (2005) and Gomes et al. (2005) to explain the current orbital
architecture of the giant planets and the origin of the Late Heavy Bombardment

of the B-emission X-ray binaries, where a sizable fraction of the neutron stars
received hardly any velocity kick at birth (Pfahl et al. 2002). The masses of
the second-born neutron stars in five of the six low-eccentricity double
neutron stars are remarkably low (between 1.18 and 1.30 Msun). It is argued
that these low-mass, low-kick neutron stars were formed by the electron-capture
collapse of the degenerate O-Ne-Mg cores of helium stars less massive than
about 3.5 Msun, whereas the higher-mass, higher kick-velocity neutron stars
were formed by the collapses of the iron cores of higher initial mass. The
absence of low-velocity single young radio pulsars (Hobbs et al. 2005) is
consistent with the model proposed by Podsiadlowski et al. (2004), in which the

galactic nuclei (AGN) in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. We
assume that a fraction of jet energy, which is generated by an AGN, is
transferred to the surrounding gas as thermal energy. Combining a theoretical
model of mass accretion onto black holes with a multiphase description of
star-forming gas, we self-consistently follow evolution of both galaxies and
their central black holes. The novelty in our model is that we consider two
distinct accretion modes: standard radiatively efficient thin accretion disks
and radiatively inefficient accretion flows which we will generically refer to
as RIAFs; motivated by theoretical models for jet production in accretion
disks, we assume that only the RIAF is responsible for the AGN feedback. We
find that, after an initial episode of bursting star formation, the accretion
rate onto the central black hole drops so that the accretion disk switches to a
RIAF structure. At this point, the feedback from the AGN becomes efficient and
slightly suppresses star formation in the galactic disk and almost completely
halts star formation in the bulge. As a result, the nucleus becomes a
stochastically fuelled low-luminosity AGN (Seyfert galaxy) with recurrent
short-lived episodes of activity after the star bursts. Our model predicts
several properties of the low-luminosity AGN including the bolometric
luminosity, jet powers, the effect on kpc-scale of the radio jet and the AGN
lifetime, which are in broad agreement with observations of Seyfert galaxies
and their radio activity. We also find that the mass ratios between the central
black hole and the the host spheroid at z = 0 are ~10^{-3} regardless of the
strength of either supernova feedback or AGN feedback. (abridged)

emission positions are known with a sub-arcsecond accuracy. The systemic
velocity inferred from the optically thin lines agrees within 3km/s with the
central velocity of the maser emission for most of the sources. About 64% of
the sources show line wings in one or more transitions of CO, HCO^+ and CS
species, indicating the presence of molecular outflows. Comparison of the
widths of line wings and methanol maser emission suggests that the 6.7GHz maser

conditions conducive for the methanol maser can exist in the inner parts of
molecular clouds or circumstellar discs as well as in the outer parts

associated to dust millimeter cores of the Vela Molecular Ridge Cloud D through
new IR observations (H_2 narrow-band at 2.12 micron and N broad band at 10.4
micron) along with an investigation performed on the existing IR catalogues.
The association of mm continuum emission with infrared sources from catalogues
(IRAS, MSX, 2MASS), JHK data from the literature and new observations, has been
established according to spatial coincidence, infrared colours and spectral
energy distributions. Only 7 out of 29 resolved mm cores (and 16 out of the 26
unresolved ones) do not exhibit signposts of star formation activity. The other
ones are clearly associated with: far-IR sources, H_2 jets or near-IR objects
showing a high intrinsic colour excess. The distribution of the spectral
indices pertaining to the associated sources is peaked at values typical of
Class I objects, while three objects are signalled as candidates Class 0
sources. We remark the high detection rate (30%) of H_2 jets driven by sources
located inside the mm-cores. They appear not driven by the most luminous
objects in the field, but rather by less luminous objects in young clusters,
testifying the co-existence of both low- and intermediate-mass star formation.
The presented results reliably describe the young population of VMR-D. However,
the statistical evaluation of activity vs inactivity of the investigated cores,
even in good agreement with results found for other star forming regions, seems
to reflect the limiting sensitivity of the available facilities rather than any
property intrinsic to the mm-condensations.

mixture of $K^0$ and $\bar{K^0}$. Denoting the density matrix by $\rho(t) =
{1/2} N(t) [\1 + \vec{\zeta}(t) \cdot \vec{\sigma} ] $, the norm of the state
$N(t)$ is found to decrease monotonically from one to zero, while the magnitude
of the Stokes vector $|\vec{\zeta}(t)|$ increases monotonically from zero to
one. This property qualifies these observables as arrows of time. Requiring
monotonic behaviour of $N(t)$ for arbitrary values of $\gamma_L, \gamma_S$ and
$\Delta m$ yields a bound on the CP-violating overlap $\delta =
\braket{K_L}{K_S}$, which is similar to, but weaker than, the known unitarity
bound. A similar requirement on $|\vec{\zeta}(t)|$ yields a new bound,
$\delta^2 < {1/2} (\frac{\Delta \gamma}{\Delta m}) \sinh (\frac{3\pi}{4}

the CP-violating overlap in the $B^0$-$\bar{B^0}$ system. We obtain the Stokes
parameter $\zeta_3(t)$ which shows how the average strangeness of the beam
evolves from zero to $\delta$. The evolution of the Stokes vector from

circumbinary in origin. The presence of OH and H2O lines confirm the
oxygen-rich nature of the circumbinary gas which is in contrast to the

profiles show that the circumbinary gas is located in a thin, rotating layer

Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2003du was obtained using a number of facilities. The
observations started 13 days before B-band maximum light and continued for 480
days with exceptionally good time sampling. The optical photometry was
calibrated through the S-correction technique.
  The UBVRIJHK light curves and the color indices of SN 2003du closely resemble
those of normal SNe Ia. SN 2003du reached a B-band maximum of 13.49 (+/-0.02)
mag on JD2452766.38 (+/-0.5). We derive a B-band stretch parameter of 0.988
(+/-0.003), which corresponds to dM15=1.02 (+/-0.05), indicative of a SN Ia of
standard luminosity. The reddening in the host galaxy was estimated by three
methods, and was consistently found to be negligible. We estimate a distance
modulus of 32.79 (+/-0.15) mag to the host galaxy, UGC 9391. The peak UVOIR
bolometric luminosity of 1.35(+/-0.20) 10^43 erg/s and Arnett's rule implies
that M(Ni56)=0.68 (+/-0.14)M_sun of Ni56 was synthesized during the explosion.
Modeling of the UVOIR bolometric light curve also indicates M(Ni56) in the
range 0.6-0.8 M_sun. The spectral evolution of SN 2003du at both optical and
NIR wavelengths also closely resembles normal SNe Ia. In particular, the Si II
ratio at maximum R(Si II)=0.22 (+/-0.02) and the time evolution of the
blueshift velocities of the absorption line minima are typical. The pre-maximum
spectra of SN 2003du showed conspicuous high-velocity features in the Ca II H&K
doublet and infrared triplet, and possibly in Si II 6355, lines. We compare the
time evolution of the profiles of these lines with other well-observed SNe Ia
and we suggest that the peculiar pre-maximum evolution of Si II 6355 line in
many SNe Ia is due to the presence of two blended absorption components.

from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope towards 23 massive star forming regions
previously known to contain molecular outflows and ultracompact HII regions. We
detected SiO towards 14 sources and suggest that the non-detections in the
other nine sources could be due to those outflows being older and without
ongoing shocks to replenish the SiO. We serendipitously detected SO$_2$ towards
17 sources in the same tuning as HCO$^+$. We detected HCO$^+$ towards all
sources, and suggest that it is tracing infall in nine cases. For seven infall
candidates, we estimate mass infall rates between 1$\times10^{-2}$ and
2$\times10^{-5}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. Seven sources show both SiO detections
(young outflows) and HCO$^+$ infall signatures. We also find that the abundance
of H$^{13}$CO$^+$ tends to increase along with the abundance of SiO in sources
for which we could determine abundances. We discuss these results with respect
to current theories of massive star formation via accretion. From this survey,
we suggest that perhaps both models of ionized accretion and halted accretion
may be important in describing the evolution of a massive protostar (or
protostars) beyond the formation of an HII region.

large-Nc limit from the mathematical theory of Pade Approximants to meromorphic
functions. These approximants are rational functions which encompass any
saturation with a finite number of resonances as a particular example,
explaining several results which have appeared in the literature. We review the
main properties of Pade Approximants with the help of a toy model for the
<VV-AA> two-point correlator, paying particular attention to the relationship
among the Chiral Expansion, the Operator Product Expansion and the resonance
spectrum. In passing, we also comment on an old proposal made by Migdal in 1977
which has recently attracted much attention in the context of AdS/QCD models.
Finally, we apply the simplest Pade Approximant to the <VV-AA> correlator in
the real case of QCD. The general conclusion is that a rational approximant may
reliably describe a Green's function in the Euclidean, but the same is not true
in the Minkowski regime due to the appearance of unphysical poles and/or
residues.

the idea of oscillations induced by the hump of the orbital velocity profile

Kerr black holes, which are characterized by a ""humpy frequency"" f_h, that
could excite the radial and vertical epicyclic oscillations with frequencies
f_r, f_v. Due to non-linear resonant phenomena the combinational frequencies
are allowed as well. Assuming mass M=14.8M_sun and spin a=0.9998 for the GRS
1915+105 Kerr black hole, the model predicts frequencies f_h=41Hz, f_r=67Hz,
(f_h+f_r)=108Hz, (f_v-f_r)=170Hz corresponding quite well to the observed ones.
For black-hole parameters being in good agreement with those given

excited by the ""hump-induced"" oscillations in a Keplerian disc, can explain
high-frequency QPOs in GRS 1915+105 within the range of observational errors.

dumbbells which are dispersed in a turbulent plane shear flow at moderate
Reynolds number. The polymer ensemble is described on the mesoscopic level by a
set of stochastic ordinary differential equations with Brownian noise. The
dynamics of the Newtonian solvent is determined by the Navier-Stokes equations.
Momentum transfer of the dumbbells with the solvent is implemented by an
additional volume forcing term in the Navier-Stokes equations, such that both
components of the resulting viscoelastic fluid are connected by a two-way
coupling. The dynamics of the dumbbells is given then by Newton's second law of
motion including small inertia effects. We investigate the dynamics of the flow
for different degrees of dumbbell elasticity and inertia, as given by
Weissenberg and Stokes numbers, respectively. For the parameters accessible in
our study, the magnitude of the feedback of the polymers on the macroscopic
properties of turbulence remains small as quantified by the global energy
budget and the Reynolds stresses. A reduction of the turbulent drag by up to
20% is observed for the larger particle inertia. The angular statistics of the
dumbbells shows an increasing alignment with the mean flow direction for both,
increasing elasticity and inertia. This goes in line with a growing asymmetry
of the probability density function of the transverse derivative of the
streamwise turbulent velocity component. We find that dumbbells get stretched
referentially in regions where vortex stretching or bi-axial strain dominate
the local dynamics and topology of the velocity gradient tensor.

cutoff. While the renormalizable Standard Model forbids proton decay mediating
operators due to accidental global symmetries, many extensions of the Standard
Model introduce such dimension four, five and six operators. Furthermore,
quantum gravity effects are expected to induce proton instability, indicating
that the higher energy cutoff scale must be above 10^{16}GeV. Quasi-realistic
heterotic string models provide the arena to explore how perturbative quantum
gravity affects the particle physics phenomenology. An appealing explanation
for the proton longevity is provided by the existence of an Abelian gauge
symmetry that suppresses the proton decay mediating operators. Additionally,
such a low-scale U(1) symmetry should: allow the suppression of the left-handed
neutrino masses by a seesaw mechanism; allow fermion Yukawa couplings to the
electroweak Higgs doublets; be anomaly free; be family universal. These
requirements render the existence of such U(1) symmetries in quasi-realistic
heterotic string models highly non-trivial. We demonstrate the existence of a
U(1) symmetry that satisfies all of the above requirements in a class of
left-right symmetric heterotic string models in the free fermionic formulation.
The existence of the extra Z' in the energy range accessible to future
experiments is motivated by the requirement of adequate suppression of proton
decay mediation. We further show that while the extra U(1) forbids dimension
four baryon number violating operators it allows dimension four lepton number
violating operators and R-parity violation.

graph with a given number of colors so that no adjacent vertices have the same
color. Using the cavity method, we present a detailed and systematic analytical
study of the space of proper colorings (solutions).
  We show that for a fixed number of colors and as the average vertex degree
(number of constraints) increases, the set of solutions undergoes several phase
transitions similar to those observed in the mean field theory of glasses.
First, at the clustering transition, the entropically dominant part of the
phase space decomposes into an exponential number of pure states so that beyond
this transition a uniform sampling of solutions becomes hard. Afterward, the
space of solutions condenses over a finite number of the largest states and
consequently the total entropy of solutions becomes smaller than the annealed
one. Another transition takes place when in all the entropically dominant
states a finite fraction of nodes freezes so that each of these nodes is
allowed a single color in all the solutions inside the state. Eventually, above
the coloring threshold, no more solutions are available. We compute all the
critical connectivities for Erdos-Renyi and regular random graphs and determine
their asymptotic values for large number of colors.
  Finally, we discuss the algorithmic consequences of our findings. We argue
that the onset of computational hardness is not associated with the clustering
transition and we suggest instead that the freezing transition might be the
relevant phenomenon. We also discuss the performance of a simple local Walk-COL
algorithm and of the belief propagation algorithm in the light of our results.

Optimization of a parametrized integral (MCO), Parametric machine-Learning
(PL), and `blackbox' or `oracle'-based optimization (BO). We make four
contributions. First, we prove that MCO is mathematically identical to a broad
class of PL problems. This identity potentially provides a new application
domain for all broadly applicable PL techniques: MCO. Second, we introduce
immediate sampling, a new version of the Probability Collectives (PC) algorithm
for blackbox optimization. Immediate sampling transforms the original BO
problem into an MCO problem. Accordingly, by combining these first two
contributions, we can apply all PL techniques to BO. In our third contribution
we validate this way of improving BO by demonstrating that cross-validation and
bagging improve immediate sampling. Finally, conventional MC and MCO procedures
ignore the relationship between the sample point locations and the associated
values of the integrand; only the values of the integrand at those locations
are considered. We demonstrate that one can exploit the sample location
information using PL techniques, for example by forming a fit of the sample
locations to the associated values of the integrand. This provides an
additional way to apply PL techniques to improve MCO.

chemically homogeneous, differentially rotating, main-sequence stars of mass
1-2 M_sun. The models were constructed using a code based on a reformulation of
the self-consistent field method of computing the equilibrium stellar structure
for a specified conservative internal rotation law. [abridged] Relative to
nonrotating stars of the same mass, these models all have reduced luminosities
and effective temperatures, and flattened photospheric shapes (i.e., decreased
polar radii) with equatorial radii that can be larger or smaller, depending on
the degree of differential rotation. For a fixed ratio of the axial rotation
rate to the surface equatorial rotation rate, increasingly rapid rotation
generally deepens convective envelopes, shrinks convective cores, and can lead
to the presence of a convective core (envelope) in a 1 M_sun (2 M_sun) model, a
feature that is absent in a nonrotating star of the same mass. The positions of
differentially rotating models for a given mass M in the H-R diagram can be
shifted in such a way as to approximate the nonrotating ZAMS over ranges in
luminosity and effective temperature that correspond to a mass interval between
M and about 0.7 M. We briefly note a few of the implications of these results,
including (i) possible ambiguities arising from similarities between the
properties of rotating and nonrotating models of different masses, (ii) a
reduced radiative luminosity for a young, rapidly rotating Sun, (iii) the
nuclear destruction of lithium and other light metallic species in the layers
beneath an outer convective envelope, and (iv), the excitation of solar-like

  figures","Astrophys.J.663:1252-1268,2007",10.1086/518687,,['astro-ph'],,"  During accretion a neutron star (NS) is spun up as angular momentum is
transported through its surface layers. We study the resulting differentially
rotating profile, focusing on the impact this has for type I X-ray bursts. The
predominant viscosity is likely provided by the Tayler-Spruit dynamo. The
radial and azimuthal magnetic field components have strengths of ~10^5 G and
~10^10 G, respectively. This leads to nearly uniform rotation at the depths of
interest for X-ray bursts. A remaining small shear transmits the accreted
angular momentum inward to the NS interior. Though this shear gives little
viscous heating, it can trigger turbulent mixing. Detailed simulations will be
required to fully understand the consequences of mixing, but our models
illustrate some general features. Mixing has the greatest impact when the
buoyancy at the compositional discontinuity between accreted matter and ashes
is overcome. This occurs at high accretion rates, at low spin frequencies, or
may depend on the ashes from the previous burst. We then find two new regimes
of burning. The first is ignition in a layer containing a mixture of heavier
elements from the ashes. If ignition occurs at the base of the mixed layer,
recurrence times as short as ~5-30 minutes are possible. This may explain the
short recurrence time of some bursts, but incomplete burning is still needed to
explain these bursts' energetics. When mixing is sufficiently strong, a second
regime is found where accreted helium mixes deep enough to burn stably,
quenching X-ray bursts. We speculate that the observed change in X-ray burst
properties near one-tenth the Eddington accretion rate is from this mechanism.
The carbon-rich material produced by stable helium burning would be important
for triggering and fueling superbursts. (abridged)

0704.1292,Excitation of the dissipationless Higgs mode in a fermionic condensate,"4 pages, 4 figures",,,,"['cond-mat.supr-con', 'cond-mat.mes-hall']",,"  The amplitude mode of a fermionic superfluid, analogous to the Higgs Boson,
becomes undamped in the strong coupling regime when its frequency is pushed
inside the BCS energy gap. We argue that this is the case in cold gases due to
the energy dispersion and nonlocality of the pairing interaction, and propose
to use the Feshbach resonance regime for parametric excitation of this mode.
The results presented for the BCS pairing dynamics indicate that even weak
dispersion suppresses dephasing and gives rise to persistent oscillations. The
frequency of oscillations extracted from our simulation of the BCS dynamics
agrees with the prediction of the many-body theory.

  Framework",,,,,['cs.SE'],,"  Many organizations aspire to adopt agile processes to take advantage of the
numerous benefits that it offers to an organization. Those benefits include,
but are not limited to, quicker return on investment, better software quality,
and higher customer satisfaction. To date however, there is no structured
process (at least in the public domain) that guides organizations in adopting
agile practices. To address this problem we present the Agile Adoption
Framework. The framework consists of two components: an agile measurement
index, and a 4-Stage process, that together guide and assist the agile adoption
efforts of organizations. More specifically, the agile measurement index is
used to identify the agile potential of projects and organizations. The 4-Stage
process, on the other hand, helps determine (a) whether or not organizations
are ready for agile adoption, and (b) guided by their potential, what set of
agile practices can and should be introduced.

and XMM-Newton observations of the high redshift (z=3.969) GRB 050730. The
X-ray afterglow of GRB 050730 was found to decline with time with superimposed
intense flaring activity that extended over more than two orders of magnitude
in time. Seven distinct re-brightening events starting from 236 s up to 41.2 ks
after the burst were observed. The underlying decay of the afterglow was well
described by a double broken power-law model with breaks at t_1= 237 +/- 20 s
and t_2 = 10.1 (-2.2) (+4.6) ks. The temporal decay slopes before, between and
after these breaks were alpha_1 = 2.1 +/- 0.3, alpha_2 = 0.44 (-0.08) (+0.14)
and alpha_3 = 2.40 (+0.07) (-0.09), respectively. The spectrum of the X-ray
afterglow was well described by a photoelectrically absorbed power-law with an
absorbing column density N_H=(1.28 +/- 0.26) 10^22 cm^-2 in the host galaxy.
Strong X-ray spectral evolution during the flaring activity was present. In the
majority of the flares (6/7) the ratio Delta_t/t_p between the duration of the
event and the time when the flare peaks was nearly constant and about 0.6-0.7.
We showed that the observed spectral and temporal properties of the first three
flares are consistent with being due both to high-latitude emission, as
expected if the flares were produced by late internal shocks, or to refreshed
shocks, i.e. late time energy injections into the main afterglow shock by slow
moving shells ejected from the central engine during the prompt phase. The
event fully satisfies the E_p-E_iso Amati relation while is not consistent with
the E_p-E_jet Ghirlanda relation.

spectral energy distribution can be approximated by a two-temperature model (25
and 63 K) with a total luminosity of approximately log(L/Lsun)=5.2. Previous
submm imaging resolved this region into a cluster of 5 dust cores, one of which
is associated with the UCHII region G23.96+0.15, and another with an H2O maser.
In our new 2.7 mm continuum image, only the UCHII region is detected, with
total flux and morphology in good agreement with the free-free emission in VLA
cm-wave maps. For the other four objects, the nondetections at 2.7 mm and in
the MSX mid-IR bands are consistent with cool dust emission with a temperature
of 13-40K and luminosity of 1000-40000 Lsun. By combining single-dish and
interferometric data, we have identified over two dozen virialized C18O cores
in this region that contain ~40% of the total molecular gas mass present. While
the overall extent of the C18O and dust emission is similar, the emission peaks
do not correlate well in detail. At least 11 of the 123 stars identified by
2MASS in this region are likely to be within the star-forming cluster. Two
stars (both associated with the UCHII region) were previously identified as O
stars via IR spectroscopy. Most of the rest of the reddened stars have no
obvious correlation with the C18O cores or the dust cores. In summary, our
observations indicate that considerable fragmentation of the molecular cloud
has taken place during the time required for the UCHII region to form and the O
stars to become detectable at IR wavelengths. Additional star formation appears
to be ongoing on the periphery of the central region, where up to four B-type
(proto)stars have formed among a substantial number of C18O molecular cores.

  Results: We determined 11 new eclipse timings of BH Lyn and derived a refined
orbital ephemeris with an orbital period of 0.155875577(14) day. During the

mag deep eclipses with mean full-width at half-flux of 0.0683(+/-0.0054)P_orb.
  The eclipse shape is highly variable, even changing form cycle to cycle. This
is most likely due to accretion disc surface brightness distribution
variations, most probably caused by strong flickering. Time-dependent accretion
disc self-occultation or variations of the hot spot(s) intensity are also
possible explanations. Negative superhumps with period of ~0.145 day are

transmit separate data streams to multiple receivers only if the transmitter

feedback from each receiver. In this work it is shown that channel feedback
requirements can be significantly reduced if each receiver has a small number
of antennas and appropriately combines its antenna outputs. A combining method
that minimizes channel quantization error at each receiver, and thereby
minimizes multi-user interference, is proposed and analyzed. This technique is
shown to outperform traditional techniques such as maximum-ratio combining
because minimization of interference power is more critical than maximization
of signal power in the multiple antenna downlink. Analysis is provided to
quantify the feedback savings, and the technique is seen to work well with user
selection and is also robust to receiver estimation error.

Complex gp, where NHI is 1.1x10^19 cm-2 and velocity is +78 km/s. Additionally,
no IV CaII K is seen in absorption in the spectrum of HD 19445, which is strong

0704.1317,Low Density Lattice Codes,"24 pages, 4 figures. Submitted for publication in IEEE transactions
  on Information Theory",,,,"['cs.IT', 'math.IT']",,"  Low density lattice codes (LDLC) are novel lattice codes that can be decoded
efficiently and approach the capacity of the additive white Gaussian noise
(AWGN) channel. In LDLC a codeword x is generated directly at the n-dimensional
Euclidean space as a linear transformation of a corresponding integer message
vector b, i.e., x = Gb, where H, the inverse of G, is restricted to be sparse.
The fact that H is sparse is utilized to develop a linear-time iterative
decoding scheme which attains, as demonstrated by simulations, good error
performance within ~0.5dB from capacity at block length of n = 100,000 symbols.
The paper also discusses convergence results and implementation considerations.

covering the inner 50 kpc of the galaxy, the Southern quadrant out to 150 kpc,
and extending to M33. This is the first systematic panoramic study of this very
outermost region of galaxies. We detect several streams and other large-scale
structures, and two new dwarf galaxies: And XV and XVI. The discovery of
substructure on the minor axis, together with the fact that the light profile
between 0.5 < R < 1.3 follows the exponential ``extended disk'', is
particularly important in shedding light on the mixed and sometimes conflicting
results reported in previous studies. Underlying the substructures lies a
faint, metal-poor, smooth and extremely extended halo, reaching out to at least
150 kpc. The smooth halo component in M31 has a profile that can be fit with a
Hernquist model of immense scale radius ~55 kpc, almost a factor of 4 larger
than theoretical predictions. Alternatively a power-law with exponent -1.91 +/-
0.11 can be fit to the profile. The total luminosity of this structure is
similar to that of the halo of the Milky Way. This vast, smooth, underlying
halo is reminiscent of a classical monolithic model and completely unexpected
from modern galaxy formation models. M33 is also found to have an extended
metal-poor halo component, which can be fit with a Hernquist model also of
scale radius ~55 kpc. These extended slowly-decreasing halos will provide a
challenge and strong constraints for further modeling. [Abridged]

information about the space of string vacua in the form of statistical
correlations between phenomenological features that are otherwise uncorrelated
in field theory. Such correlations would thus represent predictions of string
theory that hold independently of a vacuum-selection principle. In this paper,
we study statistical correlations between two features which are likely to be
central to any potential description of nature at high energy scales: gauge
symmetries and spacetime supersymmetry. We analyze correlations between these
two kinds of symmetry within the context of perturbative heterotic string
vacua, and find a number of striking features. We find, for example, that the
degree of spacetime supersymmetry is strongly correlated with the probabilities
of realizing certain gauge groups, with unbroken supersymmetry at the string
scale tending to favor gauge-group factors with larger rank. We also find that
nearly half of the heterotic landscape is non-supersymmetric and yet
tachyon-free at tree level; indeed, less than a quarter of the tree-level
heterotic landscape exhibits any supersymmetry at all at the string scale.

adiabatically, then a dense ""spike"" of dark matter is expected to have formed
around it. Assuming that dark matter is composed primarily of weakly
interacting massive particles (WIMPs), a star orbiting close enough to the SMBH
can capture WIMPs at an extremely high rate. The stellar luminosity due to
annihilation of captured WIMPs in the stellar core may be comparable to or even
exceed the luminosity of the star due to thermonuclear burning. The model thus
predicts the existence of unusual stars, i.e. ""WIMP burners"", in the vicinity
of an adiabatically grown SMBH. We find that the most efficient WIMP burners
are stars with degenerate electron cores, e.g. white dwarfs (WD) or degenerate
cores with envelopes. If found, such stars would provide evidence for the
existence of particle dark matter and could possibly be used to establish its
density profile. In our previous paper we computed the luminosity from WIMP
burning for a range of dark matter spike density profiles, degenerate core
masses, and distances from the SMBH. Here we compare our results with the
observed stars closest to the Galactic center and find that they could be
consistent with WIMP burners in the form of degenerate cores with envelopes. We
also cross-check the WIMP burner hypothesis with the EGRET observed flux of
gamma-rays from the Galactic center, which imposes a constraint on the dark
matter spike density profile and annihilation cross-section. We find that the
EGRET data is consistent with the WIMP burner hypothesis. New high precision
measurements by GLAST will confirm or set stringent limits on a dark matter
spike at the Galactic center, which will in turn support or set stringent
limits on the existence of WIMP burners at the Galactic center.

introducing a detailed treatment of the equation of state which includes
photodisintegration of helium, the condition of beta-equilibrium, and neutrino
opacities. We self-consistently calculate the chemical equilibrium in the gas
consisting of helium, free protons, neutrons and electron-positron pairs and
compute the chemical potentials of the species, as well as the electron
fraction throughout the disc. We find that, for sufficiently large accretion
rates (> 10 solar masses per second), the inner regions of the disk become
opaque and develop a viscous and thermal instability. The identification of
this instability might be relevant for GRB observations.

energy ($>1$ MeV) photon production inside a Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) fireball and
derive the expected high energy photon spectra from individual GRBs during the
prompt phase. The photon spectra of leptonic and hadronic origins are compared
within different sets of parameter regimes. Our results suggest that the high
energy emission is dominated by the leptonic component if fraction of shock
energy carried by electrons is not very small (e.g. $\epsilon_e > 10^{-3}$).
For very small values of $\epsilon_e$ the hadronic emission component could be
comparable to or even exceed the leptonic component in the GeV-TeV regime.
However, in this case a much larger energy budget of the fireball is required
to account for the same level of the observed sub-MeV spectrum. The fireballs
are therefore extremely inefficient in radiation. For a canonical fireball bulk
Lorentz factor (e.g. $\Gamma=400$), emissions above $\sim 10$ GeV are
attenuated by two-photon pair production processes. For a fireball with an even
higher Lorentz factor, the cutoff energy is higher, and emissions of 10 TeV -
PeV due to $\pi^0$-decay can also escape from the internal shocks. The flux
level is however too low to be detected by current TeV detectors, and these
photons also suffer attenuation by external soft photons.

and astrophysical parameters for 42 open clusters. While our sample is
definitively not representative of the total open cluster sample in the Galaxy,
it does cover a wide range of cluster parameters and is uniform enough to allow
for simple statistical considerations. BV wide-field CCD photometry was
obtained for open clusters for which photometric, structural, and dynamical
evolution parameters were determined. The limiting and core radii were
determined by analyzing radial density profiles. The ages, reddenings, and
distances were obtained from the solar metallicity isochrone fitting. The mass
function was used to study the dynamical state of the systems, mass segregation
effect and to estimate the total mass and number of cluster members. This study
reports on the first determination of basic parameters for 11 out of 42
observed open clusters. The angular sizes for the majority of the observed
clusters appear to be several times larger than the catalogue data indicate.
The core and limiting cluster radii are correlated and the latter parameter is
3.2 times larger on average. The limiting radius increases with the cluster's
mass, and both the limiting and core radii decrease in the course of dynamical
evolution. For dynamically not advanced clusters, the mass function slope is
similar to the universal IMF slope. For more evolved systems, the effect of
evaporation of low-mass members is clearly visible. The initial mass
segregation is present in all the observed young clusters, whereas the
dynamical mass segregation appears in clusters older than about log(age)=8.
Low-mass stars are deficient in the cores of clusters older than log(age)=8.5

those with an orbital inclination near 90 degree, are of special interest to
derive physical properties of extrasolar planets. With the knowledge of the

Combined with spectroscopic observations the mass and therefore the density can
be derived from Doppler-measurements. Depending on the brightness of the host
star, additional information, e. g. about the spin-orbit alignment between the
host star and planetary orbit, can be obtained.
  Aims: The last few years have witnessed a growing success of transit surveys.
Among other surveys, the MACHO project provided nine potential transiting
planets, several of them with relatively bright parent stars. The photometric
signature of a transit event is, however, insufficient to confirm the planetary
nature of the faint companion. The aim of this paper therefore is a
determination of the spectroscopic parameters of the host stars as well as a
dynamical mass determination through Doppler-measurements.
  Methods: We have obtained follow-up high-resolution spectra for five stars
selected from the MACHO sample, which are consistent with transits of
low-luminosity objects. Radial velocities have been determined by means of
cross-correlation with model spectra. The MACHO light curves have been compared
to simulations based on the physical parameters of the system derived from the
radial velocities and spectral analyses.
  Aims: We show that all transit light curves of the exoplanet candidates
analysed in this work can be explained by eclipses of stellar objects, hence
none of the five transiting objects is a planet.

magnetic field may together be used to produce entanglement for any finite
temperature by adjusting the external magnetic field beyond some finite
critical strength. This interesting result arises from an analysis employing
the Wootters concurrence, a computable measure of entanglement for two-qubit
states. Recently, Mintert {\em et al.} proposed generalizations of Wootters
concurrence for multipartite states. These MKB concurrences possess a
mathematical property that enables one to understand the origin of this
characteristic behavior. Here, we first study the effect of anisotropy and
magnetic field on the multipartite thermal entanglement of a four-qubit
Heisenberg XY chain using the MKB concurrences. We show that this model
exhibits characteristic behavior similar to that of the two-qubit model. In
addition, we show that this can again be understood using the same mathematical
property. Next, we show that the six-qubit Heisenberg XY chain possesses
properties necessary for it to have the characteristic behavior too. Most
importantly, it is possible to directly measure the multipartite MKB
concurrences of pure states. This may provide an experimental verification of
our conjecture that for a Heisenberg XY chain of any even number of qubits, it
is always possible to obtain non-zero genuine multipartite entanglement at any
finite temperature by applying a sufficiently large magnetic field.

stubs to be used by an application to parse network messages. Zebu is easy to
use, as it builds on notations used in RFCs to describe protocol grammars. Zebu
is also efficient, as the memory usage is tailored to application needs and
message fragments can be specified to be processed on demand. Finally,
Zebu-based applications are robust, as the Zebu compiler automatically checks
specification consistency and generates parsing stubs that include validation
of the message structure. Using a mutation analysis in the context of SIP and

  but results & conclusions the same)",,10.1086/523032,,['astro-ph'],,"  We analyse star formation in the nuclei of 9 Seyfert galaxies at spatial
resolutions down to 0.085arcsec, corresponding to length scales of less than
10pc in some objects. Our data were taken mostly with the near infrared
adaptive optics integral field spectrograph SINFONI. The stellar light profiles
typically have size scales of a few tens of parsecs. In two cases there is
unambiguous kinematic evidence for stellar disks on these scales. In the
nuclear regions there appear to have been recent - but no longer active -
starbursts in the last 10-300Myr. The stellar luminosity is less than a few
percent of the AGN in the central 10pc, whereas on kiloparsec scales the
luminosities are comparable. The surface stellar luminosity density follows a
similar trend in all the objects, increasing steadily at smaller radii up to
10^{13}L_sun/kpc^2 in the central few parsecs, where the mass surface density
exceeds 10^4M_sun/pc^2. The intense starbursts were probably Eddington limited
and hence inevitably short-lived, implying that the starbursts occur in
multiple short bursts. The data hint at a delay of 50--100Myr between the onset
of star formation and subsequent fuelling of the black hole. We discuss whether
this may be a consequence of the role that stellar ejecta could play in
fuelling the black hole. While a significant mass is ejected by OB winds and
supernovae, their high velocity means that very little of it can be accreted.
On the other hand winds from AGB stars ultimately dominate the total mass loss,
and they can also be accreted very efficiently because of their slow speeds.

introduced by Andradas, Recio and Sendra, under the name of hypercircles, as an
algorithmic cornerstone tool in the context of improving the rational
parametrization (simplifying the coefficients of the rational functions, when
possible) of algebraic varieties. A real circle can be defined as the image of
the real axis under a Moebius transformation in the complex field. Likewise,
and roughly speaking, a hypercircle can be defined as the image of a line (""the
${\mathbb{K}}$-axis"") in a $n$-degree finite algebraic extension
$\mathbb{K}(\alpha)\thickapprox\mathbb{K}^n$ under the transformation
$\frac{at+b}{ct+d}:\mathbb{K}(\alpha)\to\mathbb{K}(\alpha)$.
  The aim of this article is to extend, to the case of hypercircles, some of
the specific properties of circles. We show that hypercircles are precisely,
via $\mathbb{K}$-projective transformations, the rational normal curve of a
suitable degree. We also obtain a complete description of the points at
infinity of these curves (generalizing the cyclic structure at infinity of
circles). We characterize hypercircles as those curves of degree equal to the
dimension of the ambient affine space and with infinitely many
${\mathbb{K}}$-rational points, passing through these points at infinity.
Moreover, we give explicit formulae for the parametrization and implicitation
of hypercircles. Besides the intrinsic interest of this very special family of
curves, the understanding of its properties has a direct application to the
simplification of parametrizations problem, as shown in the last section.

shows a blackbody component appears to depend primarily on geometric factors: a
blackbody is not seen in those that have accretion footprints that are always
obscured by accretion curtains or are only visible when foreshortened on the
white-dwarf limb. Thus we argue against previous suggestions that the blackbody
emission characterises a separate sub-group of IPs which are more akin to AM
Hers, and develop a unified picture of the blackbody emission in these stars.

No significant upturn in the BSS frequency has been observed in the outskirts

the vast majority of the cluster heavy stars (binaries) has already sunk to the

order phase transition for finite systems is the bimodal distribution of an
order parameter. Previous thermodynamical studies of nuclear sources produced
in heavy-ion collisions provide information which support the existence of a
phase transition in those finite nuclear systems. Some results suggest that the
observable Z1 (charge of the biggest fragment) can be considered as a reliable
order parameter of the transition. This talk will show how from peripheral
collisions studied with the INDRA detector at GSI we can obtain this bimodal
behaviour of Z1. Getting rid of the entrance channel effects and under the
constraint of an equiprobable distribution of excitation energy (E*), we use
the canonical description of a phase transition to link this bimodal behaviour
with the residual convexity of the entropy. Theoretical (with and without phase
transition) and experimental Z1-E* correlations are compared. This comparison
allows us to rule out the case without transition. Moreover that quantitative
comparison provides us with information about the coexistence region in the
Z1-E* plane which is in good agreement with that obtained with the signal of
abnormal uctuations of configurational energy (microcanonical negative heat
capacity).

0704.1400,Reconstructing the Intrinsic Triaxial Shape of the Virgo Cluster,"submitted to ApJ, 16 page, 3 figures",,,,['astro-ph'],,"  To use galaxy clusters as a cosmological probe, it is important to account
for their triaxiality. Assuming that the triaxial shapes of galaxy clusters are
induced by the tidal interaction with the surrounding matter, Lee and Kang
recently developed a reconstruction algorithm for the measurement of the axial
ratio of a triaxial cluster. We examine the validity of this reconstruction
algorithm by performing an observational test of it with the Virgo cluster as a
target. We first modify the LK06 algorithm by incorporating the two dimensional
projection effect. Then, we analyze the 1275 member galaxies from the Virgo
Cluster Catalogue and find the projected direction of the Virgo cluster major
axis by measuring the anisotropy in the spatial distribution of the member
galaxies in the two dimensional projected plane. Applying the modified
reconstruction algorithm to the analyzed data, we find that the axial ratio of
the triaxial Virgo cluster is (1: 0.54 : 0.73). This result is consistent with
the recent observational report from the Virgo Cluster Survey, proving the
robustness of the reconstruction algorithm. It is also found that at the inner
radii the shape tends to be more like prolate. We discuss the possible effect
of the Virgo cluster triaxiality on the mass estimation.

horizon solution is defined only in terms of the conserved charges and is
therefore independent of asymptotic moduli. Starting only with the near horizon
geometry, Sen's entropy functional formalism computes the entropy of an extreme
black hole by means of a Legendre transformation where the electric fields are
defined as conjugated variables to the electric charges. However, traditional
Euclidean methods require the knowledge of the full geometry to compute the
black hole thermodynamic quantities. We establish the connection between the
entropy functional formalism and the standard Euclidean formalism taken at zero
temperature. We find that Sen's entropy function 'f' (on-shell) matches the
zero temperature limit of the Euclidean action. Moreover, Sen's near horizon
angular and electric fields agree with the chemical potentials that are defined
from the zero-temperature limit of the Euclidean formalism.

structural units of quasicrystals. The experiments of Ebert et al. imply that

currently. For a clarification we performed the first large scale fracture
simulations on three-dimensional complex binary systems. We studied the
propagation of mode I cracks in an icosahedral model quasicrystal by molecular
dynamics techniques at low temperature. In particular we examined how the shape
of the cleavage plane is influenced by the clusters inherent in the model and
how it depends on the plane structure. Brittle fracture with no indication of
dislocation activity is observed. The crack surfaces are rough on the scale of
the clusters, but exhibit constant average heights for orientations
perpendicular to high symmetry axes. From detailed analyses of the fractured
samples we conclude that both, the plane structure and the clusters, strongly
influence dynamic fracture in quasicrystals and that the clusters therefore
have to be regarded as physical entities.

primordial or collisional binary systems. In the context of dwarf spheroidal
galaxies it is hard to firmly disentangle a genuine BSS population from young
main sequence (MS) stars tracing a ~1-2 Gyr old star forming episode. Assuming
that their blue plume populations are made of BSS, we estimate the BSS
frequency for 8 Local Group non star-forming dwarf galaxies, using a
compilation of ground and space based photometry.
  Our results can be summarized as follows: (i) The BSS frequency in dwarf
galaxies, at any given Mv, is always higher than that in globular clusters of
similar luminosities; (ii) the BSS frequency for the lowest luminosity dwarf
galaxies is in excellent agreement with that observed in the Milky Way halo;
and most interestingly (iii) derive a statistically significant
anti-correlation between the BSS frequency and the galaxy Mv.
  The low density, almost collision-less, environments of our dwarf galaxy
sample allow us to infer (i) their very low dynamical evolution; (ii) a
negligible production of collisional BSS; and consequently (iii) that their
blue plumes are mainly made of primordial binaries. The dwarf galaxies
anti-correlation can be used as a discriminator: galaxies obeying the
anti-correlation are more likely to possess genuine primordial BSS rather than
young main sequence stars.

anisotropic nearest-neighbour exchange couplings on the kagome net, i.e. with
coupling J in one lattice direction and couplings J' along the other two

properties of the mineral volborthite. In the classical limit, it exhibits two
kinds of ground states: a ferrimagnetic state for J/J' < 1/2 and a large
manifold of canted spin states for J/J' > 1/2. To include quantum effects
self-consistently, we investigate the Sp(N) symmetric generalisation of the
original SU(2) symmetric model in the large-N limit. In addition to the
dependence on the anisotropy, the Sp(N) symmetric model depends on a parameter
kappa that measures the importance of quantum effects. Our numerical
calculations reveal that in the kappa-J/J' plane, the system shows a rich phase
diagram containing a ferrimagnetic phase, an incommensurate phase, and a
decoupled chain phase, the latter two with short- and long-range order. We
corroborate these results by showing that the boundaries between the various
phases and several other features of the Sp(N) phase diagram can be determined
by analytical calculations. Finally, the application of a block-spin
perturbation expansion to the trimerised version of the original spin-1/2 model
leads us to suggest that in the limit of strong anisotropy, J/J' >> 1, the
ground state of the original model is a collinearly ordered antiferromagnet,
which is separated from the incommensurate state by a quantum phase transition.

intrinsic spin of matter. Since the spins of fermions are normally randomly
oriented in macroscopic bodies, the torsion generated is normally negligible.
However, in a recent paper, Mao et al. point out that there is a class of
theories in which the angular momentum of macroscopic spinning bodies generates
a significant amount of torsion. They argue that by the principle of action
equals reaction, one would expect the angular momentum of test bodies to couple
to a background torsion field, and therefore the precession of the GPB
gyroscopes should be affected in these theories by the torsion generated by the
Earth. We show that in fact the principle of action equals reaction does not
apply to these theories. We examine in detail a generalization of the
Hayashi-Shirafuji theory suggested by Mao et al. called
Einstein-Hayashi-Shirafuji theory. There are a variety of different versions of
this theory, depending on the precise form of the coupling to matter chosen for
the torsion. We show that for any coupling to matter that is compatible with
the spin transport equation postulated by Mao et al., the theory has either
ghosts or an ill-posed initial value formulation. These theoretical problems
can be avoided by specializing the parameters of the theory and in addition
choosing the standard minimal coupling to matter of the torsion tensor. This
yields a consistent theory, but one in which the action equals reaction
principle is violated, and in which the angular momentum of the gyroscopes does
not couple to the Earth's torsion field. Thus, the Einstein-Hayashi-Shirafuji
theory does not predict a detectable torsion signal for Gravity Probe B. There
may be other torsion theories which do.

drawn i.i.d. from an unknown distribution. The key feature of our study is that
the length of the observed string is assumed to be of the same order as the

the empirical distribution tends to overestimate the probability of the
observed letters. To overcome this problem, the traditional approach to
probability estimation is to use the classical Good-Turing estimator. We
introduce a natural scaling model and use it to show that the Good-Turing
sequence probability estimator is not consistent. We then introduce a novel
sequence probability estimator that is indeed consistent under the natural
scaling model.

billiard chambers describing the asymptotic cosmological behaviour of pure
Einstein gravity in spacetime dimension d+1, or the metric-three-form system of

the Lorentzian Kac-Moody algebras AE_d, or E_{10}, respectively. This suggests
that these Kac-Moody algebras are hidden symmetries of the corresponding

consequence of sparsity of an estimator. We show that any estimator satisfying
a sparsity property has maximal risk that converges to the supremum of the loss
function; in particular, the maximal risk diverges to infinity whenever the
loss function is unbounded. For ease of presentation the result is set in the
framework of a linear regression model, but generalizes far beyond that
setting. In a Monte Carlo study we also assess the extent of the problem in
finite samples for the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) estimator

Sm2IrIn8 has a commensurate antiferromagnetic structure with a propagation
vector (1/2,0,0). The Sm magnetic moments lie in the ab plane and are rotated
roughly 18 degrees away from the a axis. The magnetic structure of this
compound was obtained by measuring the strong dipolar resonant peak whose
enhancement was of over two orders of magnitude at the L2 edge. At the L3 edge
both quadrupolar and dipolar features were observed in the energy line shape.
The magnetic structure and properties of Sm2IrIn8 are found to be consistent

current (FCNC) top quark decays, whose observation would be a clear sign of
physics beyond the standard model. Although many details of top flavor
violation are model dependent, the standard model gauge symmetries relate top
FCNCs to other processes, which are strongly constrained by existing data. We
study these constraints in a model independent way, using a low energy
effective theory from which the new physics is integrated out. We consider the
most important operators which contribute to top FCNCs and analyze the current
constraints on them. We find that the data rule out top FCNCs at a level
observable at the LHC due to most of the operators comprising left-handed first
or second generation quark fields, while there remains a substantial window for
top decays mediated by operators with right-handed charm or up quarks. If FCNC

UGC 9024. Mid- and far-infrared morphology, spectral energy distributions, and
integrated colors are used to derive the dust mass, dust-to-gas mass ratio,
total infrared luminosity, and star formation rate (SFR). The 8 micron images
indicate that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules are present in the
central regions of all three metal-poor LSB galaxies. The diffuse optical disks
of Malin 1 and UGC 9024 remain undetected at mid- and far-infrared wavelengths.
The dustiest of the three LSB galaxies, UGC 6614, has infrared morphology that
varies significantly with wavelength. The 8 and 24 micron emission is
co-spatial with H\alpha emission previously observed in the outer ring of UGC
6614. The estimated dust-to-gas ratios, from less than 10^{-3} to 10^{-2},
support previous indications that the LSB galaxies are relatively dust poor
compared to the HSB galaxies. The total infrared luminosities are approximately
1/3 to 1/2 the blue band luminosities, suggesting that old stellar populations
are the primary source of dust heating in these LSB objects. The SFR estimated
from the infrared data ranges ~0.01-0.88 M_sun yr^{-1}, consistent with results
from optical studies.

For 2+1 dynamical quark flavors, the masses of flavor-symmetric nucleons are

chiral perturbation theory. To this order the expansion includes the leading
chiral logarithms, which come from loops with virtual decuplet-like states, as
well as terms the order of the cubed pion mass, which come from loops with
virtual octet-like states. Taste violations enter through the meson propagators
in loops and tree-level terms the order of the squared lattice spacing. The
pattern of taste symmetry breaking and the resulting degeneracies and mixings
are discussed in detail. The resulting chiral forms are appropriate to lattice
results obtained with operators already in use and could be used to study the
restoration of taste symmetry in the continuum limit. I assume that the fourth

results obtained from the study of Ap and Bp stars with accurate measurements
of the mean magnetic field modulus and mean quadratic magnetic fields that
magnetic stars of mass M < 3 M_sun are concentrated towards the centre of the
main-sequence band. In contrast, stars with masses M > 3 M_sun seem to be
concentrated closer to the ZAMS. The study of a few known members of nearby
open clusters with accurate Hipparcos parallaxes confirms these conclusions.
Stronger magnetic fields tend to be found in hotter, younger and more massive
stars, as well as in stars with shorter rotation periods. No evidence is found
for any loss of angular momentum during the main-sequence life. The magnetic
flux remains constant over the stellar life time on the main sequence. An
excess of stars with large obliquities beta is detected in both higher and
lower mass stars. The obliquity angle distribution as inferred from the
distribution of r-values appears random at the time magnetic stars become
observable on the H-R diagram. After quite a short time spent on the main
sequence, the obliquity angle beta tends to reach values close to either 90 deg
or 0 deg for M < 3 M_sun. The evolution of the obliquity angle beta seems to be
somewhat different for low and high mass stars. While we find a strong hint for
an increase of beta with the elapsed time on the main sequence for stars with M
> 3 M_sun, no similar trend is found for stars with M < 3 M_sun. However, the
predominance of high values of beta at advanced ages in these stars is notable.

in q-alg/9712003 and again by Justin Roberts as problem 12.18 in ""Problems on
invariants of knots and 3-manifolds"", math.GT/0406190, essentially: ""Can one
describe the category of representations of the quantum group U_q(sl_n)
(thought of as a spherical category) via generators and relations?""
  For each n \geq 0, I define a certain tensor category of trivalent graphs,
modulo isotopy, and construct a functor from this category onto (a full
subcategory of) the category of representations of the quantum group U_q(sl_n).
One would like to describe completely the kernel of this functor, by providing
generators. The resulting quotient of the diagrammatic category would then be a
category equivalent to the representation category of U_q(sl_n).
  I make significant progress towards this, describing certain generators of
the kernel, and some obstructions to further elements. It remains a conjecture
that these relations generate the kernel. My results extend those of
q-alg/9712003, MR1659228, math.QA/0310143 and math.GT/0506403.
  The argument is essentially by constructing a diagrammatic version of the
forgetful functor coming from the inclusion of U_q(sl_{n-1}) in U_q(sl_n}. We
know this functor is faithful, so a diagram is in the kernel for n exactly if
its image under the diagrammatic forgetful functor is in the kernel for n-1.
This allows us to perform inductive calculations, both establishing families of
elements of the kernel, and finding obstructions.

through a competition between thermal and porous media flow effects in a
saturated snow layer covering the lake. The number of star arms emerges from a

pc away from the sun, taken in the F435W, F606W, and F814W bands. Scattered
light is detected up to 14'' from the star. The observations are consistent
with the presence of an extended flattened nebula with the same inclination as
the inner disk. The well-known ``spiral arms'' are clearly observed and they
trail the rotating disk material. Weaker arms never before reported are also
seen. The inter-arm space becomes brighter, but the structures become more
neutral in color at longer wavelengths, which is not consistent with models
that assume that they are due to the effects of a warped disk. Along the major
disk axis, the colors of the scattered-light relative to the star are \Delta
(F435W-F606W) ~ 0.0--0.2 mags and \Delta (F435W-F814W)~0.5--1 mags. To explain
these colors, we explore the role of asymmetric scattering, reddening, and
large minimum sizes on ISM-like grains. We conclude each of these hypotheses by
itself cannot explain the colors. The disk colors are similar to those derived
for Kuiper Belt objects, suggesting that the same processes responsible for
their colors may be at work here. We argue that we are observing only the
geometrically thick, optically thin envelope of the disk, while the optically
thick disk responsible for the far-IR emission is undetected. The observed
spiral arms are then structures on this envelope. The colors indicate that the
extended nebulosity is not a remnant of the infalling envelope but reprocessed
disk material.

manufactured from blocks of SiC produced in different lots. The thermal
expansion of the samples was measured with a cryogenic dilatometer, consisting
of a laser interferometer, a cryostat, and a mechanical cooler. The typical

temperature. For the three samples, the coefficients of thermal expansion

emissivities of the photons in the post-shock flow are taken into consideration

line profiles are most distorted by Compton scattering effects in strongly
magnetized mCVs with a low white dwarf mass and high mass accretion rate and
which are viewed at an oblique angle with respect to the accretion column. The
resulting line profiles are most sensitive to the inclination angle. We have
also explored the effects of modifying the accretion column width and using a
realistic emissivity profile. We find that these do not have a significant
overall effect on the resulting line profiles. A comparison of our simulated
line spectra with high resolution Chandra/HETGS observations of the mCV GK Per

Compton recoil near the base of the accretion column.

of evolution of the dust crystalline mass fraction in parallel with that of the
structure of the disks, in the sense that increasing crystalline mass fraction
is strongly linked to dust settling to the disk midplane. We also confirm that
the crystalline silicates are confined to small radii, r < 10 AU. However, we
see no significant correlation of crystalline mass fraction with stellar mass

photo-evaporation and condensation close to the central star,

10 AU, with or without effective radial mixing mechanisms. Either another
grain-crystallizing mechanism dominates over these, or another process must be
at work within the disks to erase the correlations they produce. We propose one

more realistic viscosity and sound-speed prescriptions than previous work to
examine the eccentric instability which underlies the superhump phenomenon in
semi-detached binaries. We illustrate the importance of the two-armed spiral
mode in the generation of superhumps. Differential motions in the fluid disc
cause converging flows which lead to strong spiral shocks once each superhump
cycle. The dissipation associated with these shocks powers the superhump. We
compare 2D and 3D results, and conclude that 3D simulations are necessary to
faithfully simulate the disc dynamics. We ran our simulations for unprecedented
durations, so that an eccentric equilibrium is established except at high mass
ratios where the growth rate of the instability is very low. Our improved
simulations give a closer match to the observed relationship between superhump
period excess and binary mass ratio than previous numerical work. The observed
black hole X-ray transient superhumpers appear to have systematically lower
disc precession rates than the cataclysmic variables. This could be due to
higher disc temperatures and thicknesses. The modulation in total viscous
dissipation on the superhump period is overwhelmingly from the region of the
disc within the 3:1 resonance radius. As the eccentric instability develops,
the viscous torques are enhanced, and the disc consequently adjusts to a new
equilibrium state, as suggested in the thermal-tidal instability model. We
quantify this enhancement in the viscosity, which is ~10 per cent for q=0.08.
We characterise the eccentricity distributions in our accretion discs, and show
that the entire body of the disc partakes in the eccentricity.

behavior is sensitive to material properties such as the collision parameters,

non-gravitational processes such as radiative cooling, photoionization/heating,

thermalization and CR acceleration efficiencies based on nonlinear diffusive
shock acceleration calculations, we then estimate the gas thermal energy and
the CR energy dissipated at shocks through the history of the universe. Since
shocks can serve as sites for generation of vorticity, we also examine the
vorticity that should have been generated mostly at curved shocks in
cosmological simulations. We find that the dynamics and energetics of shocks
are governed primarily by the gravity of matter, so other non-gravitational
processes do not affect significantly the global energy dissipation and
vorticity generation at cosmological shocks. Our results reinforce scenarios in
which the intracluster medium and warm-hot intergalactic medium contain

noncoherent block detection of QAM and PAM signals over complex-valued fading
channels. The algorithms are optimal in terms of the generalized likelihood
ratio test (GLRT). The computational complexity is polynomial in the block
length; making GLRT-optimal noncoherent detection feasible for implementation.
We also provide even lower complexity suboptimal algorithms. Simulations show
that the suboptimal algorithms have performance indistinguishable from the
optimal algorithms. Finally, we consider block based transmission, and propose
to use noncoherent detection as an alternative to pilot assisted transmission
(PAT). The new technique is shown to outperform PAT.

equation using an elastic scattering matrix element, $T_{\eta d \to \eta d}$,
which is required to be half off-shell. It is written in a factorized form,
with an off-shell form factor multiplying an on-shell part given by an
effective range expansion up to the fourth power in momentum. The parameters of
this expansion have been taken from an existing recent relativistic Faddeev
equation solution for the $\eta NN$ system corresponding to different $\eta-N$
scattering amplitudes. Calculations have also been done using few body
equations within a finite rank approximation (FRA) to generate $T_{\eta d \to

Watson-Migdal prescription by multiplying the matrix element by the inverse of
the Jost function. The $\eta-d$ interaction is found to be dominant in the
region of small invariant $\eta -d$ mass, $M_{\eta d}$. The $p-d$ interaction
enhances the cross section in the whole region of $M_{\eta d}$, but is larger

three dimensional behavior as a function of sample thickness along the

two fundamental quantum phenomena in solids: in three dimensions it can turn a
metal into a superconductor whereas in one dimension it can turn a metal into
an insulator. In two dimensions (2D) both superconductivity and charge-density
waves (CDW) are believed to be anomalous. In superconducting cuprates, critical
transition temperatures are unusually high and the energy gap may stay unclosed
even above these temperatures (pseudogap). In CDW-bearing dichalcogenides the
resistivity below the transition can decrease with temperature even faster than
in the normal phase and a basic prerequisite for the CDW, the favourable
nesting conditions (when some sections of the Fermi surface appear shifted by
the same vector), seems to be absent. Notwithstanding the existence of
alternatives to conventional theories, both phenomena in 2D still remain the
most fascinating puzzles in condensed matter physics. Using the latest
developments in high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) here we show that the normal-state pseudogap also exists in one of the
most studied 2D examples, dichalcogenide 2H-TaSe2, and the formation of CDW is
driven by a conventional nesting instability, which is masked by the pseudogap.
Our findings reconcile and explain a number of unusual, as previously believed,
experimental responses as well as disprove many alternative theoretical
approaches. The magnitude, character and anisotropy of the 2D-CDW pseudogap are
intriguingly similar to those seen in superconducting cuprates.

sodium clusters Na_n in the size range of n= 39-55. A clear evolutionary trend
in the growth of their ground-state geometries emerges. The clusters at the
beginning of the series (n=39-43) are symmetric and have partial icosahedral
(two-shell) structure. The growth then goes through a series of disordered
clusters (n=44-52) where the icosahedral core is lost. However, for n>52 a
three shell icosahedral structure emerges. This change in the nature of the
geometry is abrupt. In addition, density-functional molecular dynamics has been
used to calculate the specific heat curves for the representative sizes n= 43,
45, 48 and 52. These results along with already available thermodynamic
calculations for n= 40, 50, and 55 enable us to carry out a detailed comparison
of the heat capacity curves with their respective geometries for the entire
series. Our results clearly bring out strong correlation between the evolution
of the geometries and the nature of the shape of the heat capacities. The
results also firmly establish the size-sensitive nature of the heat capacities

arrival time problem that is also discussed. We employ the decoherent histories
approach to quantum theory, as this is the better developed formulation of
closed system quantum mechanics, and in particular, dealing with questions that
involve time in a non-trivial way. We get a very restrictive decoherence
condition, that implies that even if we do introduce an environment, there will
be very few cases that we can assign probabilities to these histories, but in
those cases, the quantum Zeno effect is still present.

i.e. B parallel to the film normal. GFT results are in good agreement with QMC
for high enough fields and temperatures. Below a critical field or a critical
temperature no collinear stable magnetization exists in GFT. On the other hand
QMC gives finite magnetization even below those critical values. This indicates
that there occurs a transition from non-collinear to collinear configurations
with increasing field or temperature. For slightly tilted external fields a
rotation of magnetization from out-of-plane to in-plane orientation is found
with decreasing temperature.

non-linear relation L(6.7um) propto L(5100A)^0.82. We also find an anti
correlation between the ratio L(6.7um)/L(5100A) and the [OIII]5007A line

the circumnuclear dust as a function of luminosity. Such a result is in
agreement with the decreasing fraction of absorbed AGNs as a function of
luminosity recently found in various surveys. We clearly detect the silicate
emission feature in the average spectrum, but also in four individual objects.

as that in Baugh et al (2005), assumes two different IMFs: a normal solar
neighbourhood IMF for quiescent star formation in disks, and a very top-heavy
IMF in starbursts triggered by galaxy mergers. We have shown previously that
the top-heavy IMF seems to be necessary to explain the number counts of faint
sub-mm galaxies. We compare the model with observational data from the SPITZER
Space Telescope, with the model parameters fixed at values chosen before
SPITZER data became available. We find that the model matches the observed
evolution in the IR remarkably well over the whole range of wavelengths probed
by SPITZER. In particular, the SPITZER data show that there is strong evolution
in the mid-IR galaxy luminosity function over the redshift range z ~ 0-2, and
this is reproduced by our model without requiring any adjustment of parameters.
On the other hand, a model with a normal IMF in starbursts predicts far too
little evolution in the mid-IR luminosity function, and is therefore excluded.

prominence oscillations is that they are damped in time and that the values of
the damping times are usually between one and three times the corresponding
oscillatory period. However, the mechanism responsible for the attenuation is
still not well-known. Aims. Thermal conduction, optically thin or thick
radiation and heating are taken into account in the energy equation, and their
role on the attenuation of prominence oscillations is evaluated. Methods. The
dispersion relation for linear non-adiabatic magnetoacoustic waves is derived
considering an equilibrium made of a prominence plasma slab embedded in an
unbounded corona. The magnetic field is orientated along the direction parallel
to the slab axis and has the same strength in all regions. By solving the
dispersion relation for a fixed wavenumber, a complex oscillatory frequency is
obtained, and the period and the damping time are computed. Results. The effect
of conduction and radiation losses is different for each magnetoacoustic mode
and depends on the wavenumber. In the observed range of wavelengths the
internal slow mode is attenuated by radiation from the prominence plasma, the
fast mode by the combination of prominence radiation and coronal conduction and
the external slow mode by coronal conduction. The consideration of the external
corona is of paramount importance in the case of the fast and external slow
modes, whereas it does not affect the internal slow modes at all. Conclusions.
Non-adiabatic effects are efficient damping mechanisms for magnetoacoustic
modes, and the values of the obtained damping times are compatible with those
observed.

surface gravity that that predicted by published theoretical models of gas

relation among these clusters with younger clusters being more metal-rich.
Analysis of the radial distribution of the clusters yields some evidence that
younger clusters (age <~ 1 Gyr) may be more concentrated toward the center of
M33 than older ones. A similar comparison with the radial profile of the M33
field stars shows the clusters to be more centrally concentrated at the greater
than 99.9% confidence level. Possible reasons for this are presented and
discussed; however, the overwhelming conclusion seems to be that a more
complete and thorough cluster search is needed covering at least 4 square
degrees centered on M33.

SDSS-DR4 with redshift information for the cluster members. We have derived
global properties for each cluster, such as their mean recessional velocity,
velocity dispersion, and virial radii. Cluster galaxies have been grouped in
two families according to their $u-r$ colours. The total sample consists of
10865 galaxies. As expected, the highest fraction of galaxies (62%) turned to
be early-type (red) ones, being located at smaller distances from the cluster
centre and showing lower velocity dispersions than late-type (blue) ones. The
brightest cluster galaxies are located in the innermost regions and show the
smallest velocity dispersions. Early-type galaxies also show constant velocity
dispersion profiles inside the virial radius and a mild decline in the
outermost regions. In contrast, late-type galaxies show always decreasing
velocity dispersions profiles. No correlation has been found between the
fraction of blue galaxies and cluster global properties, such as cluster
velocity dispersion and galaxy concentration. In contrast, we found correlation
between the X-ray luminosity and the fraction of blue galaxies. These results
indicate that early- and late-type galaxies may have had different evolution.
Thus, blue galaxies are located in more anisotropic and radial orbits than
early-type ones. Their star formation seems to be independent of the cluster
global properties in low mass clusters, but not for the most massive ones.
These observational results suggest that the global environment could be
important for driving the evolution of galaxies in the most massive cluster
($\sigma > 800$ km s$^{-1}$). However, the local environment could play a key
role in galaxy evolution for low mass clusters.

post-model-selection estimator. The notion of a post-model-selection estimator
here refers to the combined procedure resulting from first selecting a model
(e.g., by a model selection criterion like AIC or by a hypothesis testing
procedure) and then estimating the parameters in the selected model (e.g., by
least-squares or maximum likelihood), all based on the same data set. We show
that it is impossible to estimate the unconditional distribution with
reasonable accuracy even asymptotically. In particular, we show that no
estimator for this distribution can be uniformly consistent (not even locally).
This follows as a corollary to (local) minimax lower bounds on the performance
of estimators for the distribution; performance is here measured by the
probability that the estimation error exceeds a given threshold. These lower
bounds are shown to approach 1/2 or even 1 in large samples, depending on the
situation considered. Similar impossibility results are also obtained for the
distribution of linear functions (e.g., predictors) of the post-model-selection
estimator.

time-resolved spectra from 12 Seyfert 1 and 1.2 galaxies. Each spectrum is
fitted to a model with an intrinsic powerlaw X-ray spectrum produced close to
the central black hole that is reprocessed and absorbed by material around the
black hole. To test the robustness of our results, we performed Monte Carlo
simulations of the spectral sample. We find a complex relationship between the
iron line equivalent width (EW) and the underlying power law index (Gamma). The
data reveal a correlation between Gamma and EW which turns over at Gamma <~ 2,
but finds a weak anti-correlation for steeper photon indices. We propose that
this relationship is driven by dilution of a disk spectrum (which includes the
narrow iron line) by a beamed jet component and, hence, could be used as a
diagnostic of jet-dominance. In addition, our sample shows a strong correlation
between the reflection fraction (R) and Gamma, but we find that it is likely
the result of modeling degeneracies. We also see the X-ray Baldwin effect (an
anti-correlation between the 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity and EW) for the sample

neutrinos is present. We consider type II seesaw scenarios where this
additional contribution arises from the vacuum expectation value of a Higgs
triplet, and furthermore an effective model-independent approach. We
investigate bounds on the flavour-specific decay asymmetries, on the mass of
the lightest right-handed neutrino and on the reheat temperature of the early
universe, and compare them to the corresponding bounds in the type I seesaw
framework. We show that while flavour-dependent thermal type II leptogenesis
becomes more efficient for larger mass scale of the light neutrinos, and the
bounds become relaxed, the type I seesaw scenario for leptogenesis becomes more
constrained. We also argue that in general, flavour-dependent effects cannot be
ignored when dealing with leptogenesis in type II seesaw models.

astrophysical sources, foremost giving information about their geometry,
magnetic fields, and radiation mechanisms. However, very few X-ray polarization
measurements have been made, and then only mono-energetic detections, whilst
several objects are assumed to have energy dependent polarization signatures.
In this paper we investigate whether detection of energy dependent polarization
from cosmic sources is possible using the Compton technique, in particular with
the proposed PoGOLite balloon-experiment, in the 25-100 keV range. We use
Geant4 simulations of a PoGOLite model and input photon spectra based on Cygnus
X-1 and accreting magnetic pulsars (100 mCrab). Effective observing times of 6
and 35 hours were simulated, corresponding to a standard and a long duration
flight respectively. Both smooth and sharp energy variations of the
polarization are investigated and compared to constant polarization signals
using chi-square statistics. We can reject constant polarization, with energy,
for the Cygnus X-1 spectrum (in the hard state), if the reflected component is
assumed to be completely polarized, whereas the distinction cannot be made for
weaker polarization. For the accreting pulsar, constant polarization can be
rejected in the case of polarization in a narrow energy band with at least 50%
polarization, and similarly for a negative step distribution from 30% to 0%
polarization.

allowing observations to be made from the optical to gamma-ray bands. Many
other telescopes, including Konus-Wind, XMM-Newton, ROTSE and the Faulkes
Telescope North, also observed the burst. The gamma-ray, X-ray and UV/optical
emission all showed a peak ~75s after the trigger, although the optical and
X-ray afterglow components also appear early on - before, or during, the main
peak. Spectral evolution was seen throughout the burst, with the prompt
emission showing a clear positive correlation between brightness and hardness.
The Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of the prompt emission, stretching from
1eV up to 1MeV, is very flat, with a peak in the flux density at ~1keV. The
optical-to-X-ray spectra at this time are better fitted by a broken, rather
than single, power-law, similar to previous results for X-ray flares. The SED
shows spectral hardening as the afterglow evolves with time. This behaviour
might be a symptom of self-Comptonisation, although circumstellar densities
similar to those found in the cores of molecular clouds would be required. The
afterglow also decays too slowly to be accounted for by the standard models.
Although the precursor and main emission show different spectral lags, both are
consistent with the lag-luminosity correlation for long bursts. GRB 061121 is
the instantaneously brightest long burst yet detected by Swift. Using a
combination of Swift and Konus-Wind data, we estimate an isotropic energy of
2.8x10^53 erg over 1keV - 10MeV in the GRB rest frame. A probable jet break is
detected at ~2x10^5s, leading to an estimate of ~10^51 erg for the
beaming-corrected gamma-ray energy.

HEW, Half Energy Width) strongly depend on both mirrors deformations and photon
scattering caused by the microroughness of reflecting surfaces. In particular,
the contribution of X-ray Scattering (XRS) to the HEW of the optic is usually
an increasing function H(E) of the photon energy E. Therefore, in future hard
X-ray imaging telescopes of the future (SIMBOL-X, NeXT, Constellation-X, XEUS),
the X-ray scattering could be the dominant problem since they will operate also
in the hard X-ray band (i.e. beyond 10 keV). [...]
  Several methods were proposed in the past years to estimate the scattering
contribution to the HEW, dealing with the surface microroughness expressed in
terms of its Power Spectral Density (PSD), on the basis of the well-established
theory of X-ray scattering from rough surfaces. We faced that problem on the
basis on the same theory, but we tried a new approach: the direct, analytical
translation of a given surface roughness PSD into a H(E) trend, and - vice
versa - the direct translation of a H(E) requirement into a surface PSD. This
PSD represents the maximum tolerable microroughness level in order to meet the
H(E) requirement in the energy band of a given X-ray telescope.
  We have thereby found a new, analytical and widely applicable formalism to
compute the XRS contribution to the HEW from the surface PSD, provided that the
PSD had been measured in a wide range of spatial frequencies. The inverse
problem was also solved, allowing the immediate evaluation of the mirror
surface PSD from a measured function H(E). The same formalism allows
establishing the maximum allowed PSD of the mirror in order to fulfill a given
H(E) requirement. [...]

over another. My objective is to illustrate the fundamental role of contacts
and demons in transport and energy conversion. The discussion is kept at an
academic level steering clear of real world details, but the illustrative
devices we use are very much within the capabilities of present-day technology.
For example, recent experiments on thermoelectric effects in molecular
conductors agree well with the predictions from our model. The Maxwell's demon
device itself is very similar to the pentalayer spin-torque device which has
been studied by a number of groups though we are not aware of any discussion of
the possibility of using the device as a nanoscale heat engine or as a
refrigerator as proposed here. However, my objective is not to evaluate
possible practical applications. Rather it is to introduce a simple transparent
model showing how out-of-equibrium demons suitably incorporated into
nanodevices can achieve energy conversion.

the uniform distribution on proper 7-colourings of a finite rectangular
sub-grid of the infinite square lattice, the grid. A systematic scan Markov
chain cycles through finite-size subsets of vertices in a deterministic order
and updates the colours assigned to the vertices of each subset. The systematic
scan Markov chain that we present cycles through subsets consisting of 2x2
sub-grids and updates the colours assigned to the vertices using a procedure
known as heat-bath. We give a computer-assisted proof that this systematic scan
Markov chain mixes in O(log n) scans, where n is the size of the rectangular
sub-grid. We make use of a heuristic to compute required couplings of
colourings of 2x2 sub-grids. This is the first time the mixing time of a
systematic scan Markov chain on the grid has been shown to mix for less than 8
colours. We also give partial results that underline the challenges of proving
rapid mixing of a systematic scan Markov chain for sampling 6-colourings of the

reason for previous disagreements stems from the need to analyze both singular

lithosphere, or as a dynamical effect due to lithospheric flexure caused by
mantle convection. In both cases the response of the lithosphere to external
forces can be calculated with the theory of thin elastic plates or shells. On
one-plate planets the spherical geometry of the lithospheric shell plays an
important role in the flexure mechanism. So far the equations governing the
deformations and stresses of a spherical shell have only been derived under the
assumption of a shell of constant thickness. However local studies of gravity
and topography data suggest large variations in the thickness of the
lithosphere. In this article we obtain the scalar flexure equations governing
the deformations of a thin spherical shell with variable thickness or variable
Young's modulus. The resulting equations can be solved in succession, except
for a system of two simultaneous equations, the solutions of which are the
transverse deflection and an associated stress function. In order to include
bottom loading generated by mantle convection, we extend the method of stress
functions to include loads with a toroidal tangential component. We further
show that toroidal tangential displacement always occurs if the shell thickness
varies, even in the absence of toroidal loads. We finally prove that the
degree-one harmonic components of the transverse deflection and of the toroidal
tangential displacement are independent of the elastic properties of the shell
and are associated with translational and rotational freedom. The flexure
equations for a shell of variable thickness are useful not only for the
prediction of the gravity signal in local admittance studies, but also for the
construction of stress maps in tectonic analysis.

  (Accepted for ApJL)",,10.1086/522337,,['astro-ph'],,"  In the decreasing intrinsic redshift (DIR) model galaxies are assumed to be
born as compact objects that have been ejected with large intrinsic redshift
components, z_(i), out of the nuclei of mature AGN galaxies. As young AGN
(quasars) they are initially several magnitudes sub-luminous to mature galaxies
but their luminosity gradually increases over 10^8 yrs, as z_(i) decreases and
they evolve into mature AGN (Seyferts and radio galaxies). Evidence presented
here that low- and intermediate-redshift AGN are unquestionably sub-luminous to
radio galaxies is then strong support for this model and makes it likely that
the high-redshift AGN (quasars) are also sub-luminous, having simply been
pushed above the radio galaxies on a logz-m_(v) plot by the presence of a large
intrinsic component in their redshifts. An increase in luminosity below z =
0.06 is also seen. It is associated in the DIR model with an increase in
luminosity as the sources mature but, if real, is difficult to interpret in the
cosmological redshift (CR) model since at this low redshift it is unlikely to
be associated with a higher star formation rate or an increase in the material
used to build galaxies. Whether it might be possible in the CR model to explain
these results by selection effects is also examined.

not find a hot spot or gas stream around the outer boundaries of the accretion
disk. Instead, we detected a strong narrow emission near the location of the
secondary star. We measured the radial velocity curve from the wings of the
double-peaked H$\alpha$ emission line, and obtained a semi-amplitude value that
is in excellent agreement with the obtained from observations in the
ultraviolet spectral region by Sion et al. (1998). We present also a new method
to obtain K_2, which enhances the detection of absorption or emission features
arising in the late-type companion. Our results are compared with published
values derived from the near-infrared NaI line doublet. From a comparison of
the TiO band with those of late type M stars, we find that a best fit is
obtained for a M6V star, contributing 5 percent of the total light at that
spectral region. Assuming that the radial velocity semi-amplitudes reflect
accurately the motion of the binary components, then from our results: K_em =
107+/-2 km/s; K_abs = 310+/-5 km/s, and using the inclination angle given by
Zhang & Robinson(1987); i = 69.7+/-0.7, the system parameters become: M_WD =

radius of R_out/a ~0.61, close to the distance of the inner Lagrangian point

simultaneously a roton minima in the density excitation spectra. On the

the well known spectra for the Heisenberg antiferromagnet. On the

version of our charge exchange emission model (Bodewits et al. 2006). We have
applied this model to the sample of 8 comets thus far observed with the Chandra
X-ray observatory and ACIS spectrometer in the 300-1000 eV range. The surveyed
comets are C/1999 S4 (LINEAR), C/1999 T1 (McNaught-Hartley), C/2000 WM1
(LINEAR), 153P/2002 (Ikeya-Zhang), 2P/2003 (Encke), C/2001 Q4 (NEAT), 9P/2005
(Tempel 1) and 73P/2006-B (Schwassmann-Wachmann 3) and the observations include
a broad variety of comets, solar wind environments and observational
conditions. The interaction model is based on state selective, velocity
dependent charge exchange cross sections and is used to explore how cometary
X-ray emission depend on cometary, observational and solar wind
characteristics. It is further demonstrated that cometary X-ray spectra mainly
reflect the state of the local solar wind. The current sample of Chandra
observations was fit using the constrains of the charge exchange model, and
relative solar wind abundances were derived from the X-ray spectra. Our
analysis showed that spectral differences can be ascribed to different solar
wind states, as such identifying comets interacting with (I) fast, cold wind,
(II), slow, warm wind and (III) disturbed, fast, hot winds associated with
interplanetary coronal mass ejections. We furthermore predict the existence of
a fourth spectral class, associated with the cool, fast high latitude wind.

the concordance FRW model with the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ is a global
attractor situated on a 2-dimensional invariant space. We also study the
behaviour near this attractor, which can be approximated by the dynamics of the
linearized part of the system. We demonstrate that trajectories of the
conformally coupled phantom scalar field with a simple quadratic potential
crosses the cosmological constant barrier infinitely many times in the phase

calculated. We conclude that the phantom scalar field conformally coupled to

= 1.5 Myr) whose most likely source was a nearby supernova. Previous models of
Solar System formation considered a supernova shock that triggered the collapse
of the Sun's nascent molecular cloud. We advocate an alternative hypothesis,
that the Solar System's protoplanetary disk had already formed when a very
close (< 1 pc) supernova injected radioactive material directly into the disk.
We conduct the first numerical simulations designed to answer two questions
related to this hypothesis: will the disk be destroyed by such a close
supernova; and will any of the ejecta be mixed into the disk? Our simulations
demonstrate that the disk does not absorb enough momentum from the shock to
escape the protostar to which it is bound. Only low amounts (< 1%) of mass loss
occur, due to stripping by Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities across the top of the
disk, which also mix into the disk about 1% of the intercepted ejecta. These
low efficiencies of destruction and injectation are due to the fact that the
high disk pressures prevent the ejecta from penetrating far into the disk
before stalling. Injection of gas-phase ejecta is too inefficient to be
consistent with the abundances of radionuclides inferred from meteorites. On
the other hand, the radionuclides found in meteorites would have condensed into
dust grains in the supernova ejecta, and we argue that such grains will be
injected directly into the disk with nearly 100% efficiency. The meteoritic
abundances of the short-lived radionuclides such as 60Fe therefore are
consistent with injection of grains condensed from the ejecta of a nearby (< 1
pc) supernova, into an already-formed protoplanetary disk.

happen for scaling cosmologies. This note contains a further study of such

first-order equations we derive using a Bogomol'nyi-like method. In particular
we show that scaling solutions that are pseudo-BPS must describe geodesic
curves. Furthermore, we clarify how to solve the geodesic equations of motion
when the scalar manifold is a maximally non-compact coset such as occurs in
maximal supergravity. This relies upon a parametrization of the coset in the

derivation of cosmological parameters. The published distant and local Ia SNe
used for the Supernova Legacy Survey first-year cosmology report form the
sample for this study. While previous work has assumed that the local SNe are
at rest in the CMB frame (the No Flow assumption), we test this assumption by
applying peculiar velocity corrections to the local SNe using three different
flow models. The models are based on the IRAS PSCz galaxy redshift survey, have
varying beta = Omega_m^0.6/b, and reproduce the Local Group motion in the CMB
frame. These datasets are then fit for w, Omega_m, and Omega_Lambda using
flatness or LambdaCDM and a BAO prior. The chi^2 statistic is used to examine
the effect of the velocity corrections on the quality of the fits. The most
favored model is the beta=0.5 model, which produces a fit significantly better
than the No Flow assumption, consistent with previous peculiar velocity
studies. By comparing the No Flow assumption with the favored models we derive
the largest potential systematic error in w caused by ignoring peculiar
velocities to be Delta w = +0.04. For Omega_Lambda, the potential error is
Delta Omega_Lambda = -0.04 and for Omega_m, the potential error is Delta
Omega_m < +0.01. The favored flow model (beta=0.5) produces the following
cosmological parameters: w = -1.08 (+0.09,-0.08), Omega_m = 0.27 (+0.02,-0.02)

one-dimensional 1/4-filled band, the singlet ground state is a Wigner crystal
only if the nearest neighbor electron-electron repulsion is larger than a
critical value. We show that this critical nearest neighbor Coulomb interaction
is different for each spin subspace, with the critical value decreasing with
increasing spin. As a consequence, with the lowering of temperature, there can
occur a transition from a Wigner crystal charge-ordered state to a spin-Peierls
state that is a Bond-Charge-Density Wave with charge occupancies different from
the Wigner crystal. This transition is possible because spin excitations from
the spin-Peierls state in the 1/4-filled band are necessarily accompanied by
changes in site charge densities. We apply our theory to the 1/4-filled band
quasi-one-dimensional organic charge-transfer solids in general and to 2:1
tetramethyltetrathiafulvalene (TMTTF) and tetramethyltetraselenafulvalene
(TMTSF) cationic salts in particular. We believe that many recent experiments
strongly indicate the Wigner crystal to Bond-Charge-Density Wave transition in
several members of the TMTTF family. We explain the occurrence of two different
antiferromagnetic phases but a single spin-Peierls state in the generic phase
diagram for the 2:1 cationic solids. The antiferromagnetic phases can have
either the Wigner crystal or the Bond-Charge-Spin-Density Wave charge
occupancies. The spin-Peierls state is always a Bond-Charge-Density Wave.

Galactic Nuclei (AGN) sample obtained from the first epoch data of the
VIMOS-VLT Deep Survey (VVDS). The sample consists of 130 faint, broad-line AGN
with redshift up to z=5 and 17.5< I <24.0, selected on the basis of their
spectra. In this paper we present the measurement of the Optical Luminosity
Function up to z=3.6 derived from this sample, we compare our results with
previous results from brighter samples both at low and at high redshift. Our
data, more than one magnitude fainter than previous optical surveys, allow us
to constrain the faint part of the luminosity function up to high redshift. By
combining our faint VVDS sample with the large sample of bright AGN extracted
from the SDSS DR3 (Richards et al., 2006b) and testing a number of different
evolutionary models, we find that the model which better represents the
combined luminosity functions, over a wide range of redshift and luminosity, is
a luminosity dependent density evolution (LDDE) model, similar to those derived
from the major X-surveys. Such a parameterization allows the redshift of the
AGN space density peak to change as a function of luminosity and explains the
excess of faint AGN that we find at 1.0< z <1.5. On the basis of this model we
find, for the first time from the analysis of optically selected samples, that
the peak of the AGN space density shifts significantly towards lower redshift
going to lower luminosity objects. This result, already found in a number of
X-ray selected samples of AGN, is consistent with a scenario of ""AGN cosmic
downsizing"", in which the density of more luminous AGN, possibly associated to
more massive black holes, peaks earlier in the history of the Universe, than
that of low luminosity ones.

low flux, or low mass, and it does not include low redshift clusters with high

investigate the phenomenon of noise correlation in molecular networks.
Specifically, we focus on the metabolic network, which is highly inter-linked,

analogy between the dynamics of a linear metabolic pathway and that of the
exactly soluable linear queueing network or, alternatively, a mass transfer
system, we derive a plethora of results concerning fluctuations in the
abundance of intermediate metabolites in various common motifs of the metabolic
network. For all but one case examined, we find the steady-state fluctuation in
different nodes of the pathways to be effectively uncorrelated. Consequently,
fluctuations in enzyme levels only affect local properties and do not propagate
elsewhere into metabolic networks, and intermediate metabolites can be freely
shared by different reactions. Our approach may be applicable to study
metabolic networks with more complex topologies, or protein signaling networks

  Methods. A ten-night observational campaign was performed using the
Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (3.6m), the San Pedro M\'artir telescope (2.1m),
and the Loiano telescope (1.5m). To increase the transit detection probability
we also made use of the Bruntt et al. (2003) eight-nights observational
campaign. Adequate photometric precision for the detection of planetary
transits was achieved.
  Results. Should the frequency and properties of close-in planets in NGC 6791
be similar to those orbiting field stars of similar metallicity, then detailed
simulations foresee the presence of 2-3 transiting planets. Instead, we do not
confirm the transit candidates proposed by Bruntt et al. (2003). The
probability that the null detection is simply due to chance coincidence is
estimated to be 3%-10%, depending on the metallicity assumed for the cluster.
  Conclusions. Possible explanations of the null-detection of transits include:
(i) a lower frequency of close-in planets in star clusters; (ii) a smaller
planetary radius for planets orbiting super metal rich stars; or (iii)
limitations in the basic assumptions. More extensive photometry with 3-4m class
telescopes is required to allow conclusive inferences about the frequency of
planets in NGC 6791.

5.7 have rest-frame equivalent widths (EW) greater than ~100 Angstrom. However
only a small fraction of the Lya flux produced by a galaxy is transmitted
through the IGM, which implies intrinsic Lya EWs that are in excess of the
maximum allowed for a population-II stellar population having a Salpeter mass
function. In this paper we study characteristics of the sources powering Lya
emission in high redshift galaxies. We propose a simple model for Lya emitters
in which galaxies undergo a burst of very massive star formation that results
in a large intrinsic EW, followed by a phase of population-II star formation
with a lower EW. We confront this model with a range of high redshift
observations and find that the model is able to simultaneously describe the
following eight properties of the high redshift galaxy population with
plausible values for parameters like the efficiency and duration of star
formation: i-iv) the UV and Lya luminosity functions of LAEs at z=5.7 and 6.5,
v-vi) the mean and variance of the EW distribution of Lya selected galaxies at
z=5.7, vii) the EW distribution of i-drop galaxies at z~6, and viii) the
observed correlation of stellar age with EW. Our modeling suggests that the
observed anomalously large intrinsic equivalent widths require a burst of very
massive star formation lasting no more than a few to ten percent of the
galaxies star forming lifetime. This very massive star formation may indicate
the presence of population-III star formation in a few per cent of i-drop
galaxies, and in about half of the Lya selected galaxies.

searching it. One option is tag search, which returns all images tagged with a
specific keyword. If the keyword is ambiguous, e.g., ``beetle'' could mean an
insect or a car, tag search results will include many images that are not
relevant to the sense the user had in mind when executing the query. We claim
that users express their photography interests through the metadata they add in
the form of contacts and image annotations. We show how to exploit this
metadata to personalize search results for the user, thereby improving search
performance. First, we show that we can significantly improve search precision
by filtering tag search results by user's contacts or a larger social network
that includes those contact's contacts. Secondly, we describe a probabilistic
model that takes advantage of tag information to discover latent topics
contained in the search results. The users' interests can similarly be
described by the tags they used for annotating their images. The latent topics
found by the model are then used to personalize search results by finding

$\Gamma$-law equation of state, commonly adopted in a wide range of
astrophysical applications, is compared with a more realistic equation of state
that better approximates the single-specie relativistic gas. The paper focus on
three different topics. First, the influence of a more realistic equation of
state on the propagation of fast magneto-sonic shocks is investigated. This
calls into question the validity of the constant $\Gamma$-law equation of state
in problems where the temperature of the gas substantially changes across
hydromagnetic waves. Second, we present a new inversion scheme to recover
primitive variables (such as rest-mass density and pressure) from conservative
ones that allows for a general equation of state and avoids catastrophic
numerical cancellations in the non-relativistic and ultrarelativistic limits.
Finally, selected numerical tests of astrophysical relevance (including
magnetized accretion flows around Kerr black holes) are compared using
different equations of state. Our main conclusion is that the choice of a
realistic equation of state can considerably bear upon the solution when
transitions from cold to hot gas (or viceversa) are present. Under these
circumstances, a polytropic equation of state can significantly endanger the
solution.

decay by fragmentation and formation of clusters. The random orientation of the
CNTs and the electromechanical interaction are then modeled to explain the
self-assembly. The degraded state of the CNTs and the electromechanical force
are employed to update the orientation of the CNTs. Field emission current at
the device scale is finally obtained by using the Fowler-Nordheim equation and
integration over the computational cell surfaces on the anode side. The
simulated results are in close agreement with the experimental results. Based

thin inner disc surrounded by an optically thick outer disc) suggest that
significant disc evolution has occured in these systems. We explore the nature
of these systems by examining their demographics, specifically their stellar
accretion rates (Mdot) and disc masses (Mdisc) compared to those of accreting T
Tauri stars of comparable age. We find that transition objects in Taurus occupy
a restricted region of the Mdot vs. Mdisc plane. Compared to non-transition
single stars in Taurus, they have stellar accretion rates that are typically
~10 times lower at the same disc mass and median disc masses ~4 times larger.
These properties are anticipated by several proposed planet formation theories
and suggest that the formation of Jovian mass planets may play a significant
role in explaining the origin of at least some transition objects. Considering
transition objects as a distinct demographic group among accreting T Tauri
stars leads to a tighter relationship between disc masses and stellar accretion
rates, with a slope between the two quantities that is close to the value of
unity expected in simple theories of disc accretion.

edges grows faster than the network size. In this paper, we propose a simple
weighted network model with accelerating growth. We derive analytical
expressions for the evolutions and distributions for strength, degree, and
weight, which are relevant to accelerating growth. We also find that
accelerating growth determines the clustering coefficient of the networks.
Interestingly, the distributions for strength, degree, and weight display a
transition from scale-free to exponential form when the parameter with respect
to accelerating growth increases from a small to large value. All the
theoretical predictions are successfully contrasted with extensive numerical
simulations.

formula which is highly valid for the excitation energy of the first excited

explicitly that the $N_p N_n$ scheme for the excitation energy emerges from the
separate exponential dependence of the excitation energy on the valence nucleon

numbers is allowed for the $N_p$ and $N_n$ of the existing nuclei.

0704.1694,"Locally Decodable Codes From Nice Subsets of Finite Fields and Prime
  Factors of Mersenne Numbers",18 pages,,,,"['cs.CC', 'math.NT']",,"  A k-query Locally Decodable Code (LDC) encodes an n-bit message x as an N-bit
codeword C(x), such that one can probabilistically recover any bit x_i of the
message by querying only k bits of the codeword C(x), even after some constant
fraction of codeword bits has been corrupted. The major goal of LDC related
research is to establish the optimal trade-off between length and query
complexity of such codes.
  Recently [Y] introduced a novel technique for constructing locally decodable
codes and vastly improved the upper bounds for code length. The technique is
based on Mersenne primes. In this paper we extend the work of [Y] and argue
that further progress via these methods is tied to progress on an old number
theory question regarding the size of the largest prime factors of Mersenne
numbers.
  Specifically, we show that every Mersenne number m=2^t-1 that has a prime
factor p>m^\gamma yields a family of k(\gamma)-query locally decodable codes of
length Exp(n^{1/t}). Conversely, if for some fixed k and all \epsilon > 0 one
can use the technique of [Y] to obtain a family of k-query LDCs of length
Exp(n^\epsilon); then infinitely many Mersenne numbers have prime factors arger
than known currently.

assumed discrete, and two closely located excited levels are taken into

the light wave, corresponding to the pulse carrying frequency) is considered,
and the dependance of the interband matrix element of the momentum operator on
the light wave vector is taken into account. Refractive indices of barriers and
quantum well are assumed equal each other. The problem is solved for an
arbitrary ratio of radiative and nonradiative lifetimes of electronic
excitations. It is shown that the spatial dispersion essentially affects the

The power law spectrum of protons extends up to the energy $3\times 10^{15}$ eV

accelerated nuclei is proportional to their charge number $Z$. Therefore the

transition, antiferromagnetic transition and topological one (Fermi surface
reconstruction). In a wide region of parameters, these two transitions occur
simultaneously without the breakdown of Kondo screening, accompanied by a
discontinuous change of the Hall coefficient. This result is consistent with
the experiment and gives a novel theoretical picture for the quantum critical
point in heavy fermion systems.

the quantum theory of spectral line polarization, which self-consistently
accounts for the Hanle and Zeeman effects in the most general case of the
incomplete Paschen-Back effect regime. We also take into account radiative
transfer effects. An efficient numerical scheme based on global optimization
methods has been applied. Our Stokes inversion code permits a fast and reliable

results from other independent optical follow up programs, led to the
spectroscopic identification of all sources in the sample. We carried out a
systematic spectroscopic campaign for the observation of all unidentified

new BL Lacs and 5 new redshifts for the previously known objects. The redshift

critical for the present proposal. A quantum hologram has a higher storage
capacity compared to a classical hologram, and is capable of storing quantum

discovery of a kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in 1A 1246-588. The
kilohertz QPO was only detected when the source was in a soft high-flux state
reminiscent of the lower banana branch in atoll sources. Only one kilohertz QPO
peak is detected at a relatively high frequency of 1258+-2 Hz and at a single
trial significance of more than 7 sigma. Kilohertz QPOs with a higher frequency
have only been found on two occasions in 4U 0614+09. Furthermore, the frequency
is higher than that found for the lower kilohertz QPO in any source, strongly
suggesting that the QPO is the upper of the kilohertz QPO pair often found in
LMXBs. The full-width at half maximum is 25+-4 Hz, making the coherence the
highest found for an upper kilohertz QPO. From a distance estimate of ~6 kpc
from a radius expansion burst we derive that 1A 1246-588 is at a persistent
flux of ~0.2-0.3 per cent of the Eddington flux, hence 1A 1246-588 is one of
the weakest LMXBs for which a kilohertz QPO has been detected. The
root-mean-square (rms) amplitude in the 5-60 keV band is 27+-3 per cent, this
is the highest for any kilohertz QPO source so far, in line with the general
anti-correlation between source luminosity and rms amplitude of the kilohertz
QPO peak identified before. Using the X-ray spectral information we produce a
colour-colour diagram. The source behaviour in this diagram provides further
evidence for the atoll nature of the source.

by formalizing the well established spring layout in terms of dynamic
equations. We thus open up the design space for new algorithms. Drawing from
the knowledge of systems design, we derive a layout algorithm that remedies
several drawbacks of the original spring layout. This new algorithm relies on
the balancing of two antagonistic forces. We thus call it {\em arf} for
""attractive and repulsive forces"". It is, as we claim, particularly suited for
a dynamic layout of smaller networks ($n < 10^3$). We back this claim with
several application examples from on going complex systems research.

basic properties of entropy or mutual information, up to now Shannon's entropy
power inequality (EPI) is an exception: Existing information theoretic proofs
of the EPI hinge on representations of differential entropy using either Fisher
information or minimum mean-square error (MMSE), which are derived from de
Bruijn's identity. In this paper, we first present an unified view of these
proofs, showing that they share two essential ingredients: 1) a data processing
argument applied to a covariance-preserving linear transformation; 2) an
integration over a path of a continuous Gaussian perturbation. Using these
ingredients, we develop a new and brief proof of the EPI through a mutual
information inequality, which replaces Stam and Blachman's Fisher information
inequality (FII) and an inequality for MMSE by Guo, Shamai and Verd\'u used in
earlier proofs. The result has the advantage of being very simple in that it
relies only on the basic properties of mutual information. These ideas are then
generalized to various extended versions of the EPI: Zamir and Feder's
generalized EPI for linear transformations of the random variables, Takano and
Johnson's EPI for dependent variables, Liu and Viswanath's
covariance-constrained EPI, and Costa's concavity inequality for the entropy

  (Durham, UK). 8 pages, 5 figures",,,,['astro-ph'],,"  The properties of galaxies are strongly correlated with their environment,
with red galaxies dominating galaxy clusters and blue galaxies dominating the
general field. However, not all field galaxies are young: studies of the
colors, line strengths, and M/L ratios of massive early-type galaxies at
0<z<1.3 show that the most massive galaxies do not seem to care about their
surroundings, and have very similar ages irrespective of their environment.
There is good evidence that the growth of these galaxies does continue longer
in the field than in clusters, via (nearly) dissipationless mergers of already
old galaxies. These results are consistent with predictions of recent galaxy
formation models, which incorporate AGN feedback to suppress star formation in
the most massive halos. Systematic studies of the relation of galaxies with
their environment beyond z=1 are difficult, and still somewhat contradictory.
Intriguingly both the DEEP2 and VVDS surveys find that the color-density
relation disappears at z~1.3, unfortunately just at the point where both
surveys become highly incomplete. On the other hand, clustering studies at
z~2.5 have shown that red galaxies cluster more strongly than blue galaxies,

pertinent to (0,2) models. Second, we review constructions of Calabi-Yau
complete intersections within such flag manifolds, and properties of the gauged
linear sigma models. We discuss a number of examples of nonabelian GLSM's in
which the Kahler phases are not birational, and in which at least one phase is
realized in some fashion other than as a complete intersection, extending
previous work of Hori-Tong. We also review an example of an abelian GLSM
exhibiting the same phenomenon. We tentatively identify the mathematical
relationship between such non-birational phases, as examples of Kuznetsov's
homological projective duality. Finally, we discuss linear sigma model moduli
spaces in these gauged linear sigma models. We argue that the moduli spaces
being realized physically by these GLSM's are precisely Quot and hyperquot
schemes, as one would expect mathematically.

ULIRGs spanning z~1-3 and likely L_IR~10^12-10^13Lsun. Our study aims at
quantifying the star-formation and AGN processes in these sources which recent
results suggest have evolved strongly between the observed epoch and today. To
do this, we study the mid-IR contribution of PAH emission, continuum, and
extinction. About 3/4 of our sample are continuum- (i.e. AGN) dominated
sources, but ~60% of these show PAH emission, suggesting the presence of
star-formation activity. These sources have redder mid-IR colors than typical
optically-selected quasars. About 25% of our sample have strong PAH emission,
but none are likely to be pure starbursts as reflected in their relatively high
5um hot dust continua. However, their steep 30um-to-14um slopes suggest that
star-formation might dominate the total infrared luminosity. Six of our z~2
sources have EW6.2>~0.3um and L_14um>~10^12Lsun (implying L_IR>~10^13Lsun). At
these luminosities, such high EW6.2 ULIRGs do not exist in the local Universe.
We find a median optical depth at 9.7um of <tau_9.7>=1.4. This is consistent
with local IRAS-selected ULIRGs, but differs from early results on
SCUBA-selected z~2 ULIRGs. Similar to local ULIRGs about 25% of our sample show
extreme obscuration (tau_9.7>~3) suggesting buried nuclei. In general, we find
that our sources are similar to local ULIRGs, but are an order of magnitude
more luminous. It is not clear whether our z~2 ULIRGs are simply scaled-up
versions of local ULIRGs, or subject to fundamentally different physical
processes.

the virial velocity of the halo: \sigma_{sat}/V_{vir}=0.9 +/- 0.2. Applied to
the Milky Way and M31 this gives V_{vir}^{MW}=109 +/- 22$ km/s and
V_{vir}^{M31} = 138 +/- 35 km/s, respectively, substantially lower than the
rotation speed of their disk components. The detailed kinematics of simulated
satellites and dark matter are also in good agreement. By contrast, the stellar
halo of the simulated galaxies is kinematically and spatially distinct from the
population of surviving satellites. This is because the survival of a satellite
depends on mass and on time of accretion; surviving satellites are biased
toward low-mass systems that have been recently accreted by the galaxy. Our
results support recent proposals for the origin of the systematic differences
between stars in the Galactic halo and in Galactic satellites: the elusive
``building blocks'' of the Milky Way stellar halo were on average more massive,

two-dimensional velocity distributions in the UV, UW, and VW planes are
analyzed. The evolution of the main peaks in the velocity distributions can be
followed to an average age of approximately 9 Gyr. We find that: (1) in the
distributions of the UV velocity components, stars of different types are
concentrated toward several stable peaks (the Hyades, Pleiades, and Sirius
Cluster), suggesting that the stars belonging to these formations did not form
simultaneously; (2) the peak associated with the Hyades Cluster dominates in
all age intervals; and (3) the Hyades peak is strongest for stars with an

fraction of stars from the Hyades cluster. The age dependences of the kinematic

N-body/gasdynamical simulations of the formation of $L_*$ galaxies in a LCDM
universe. Most satellites follow conventional orbits; after turning around,
they accrete into their host halo and settle on orbits whose apocentric radii
are steadily eroded by dynamical friction. However, a number of outliers are
also present, we find that ~1/3 of satellites identified at $z=0$ are on
unorthodox orbits, with apocenters that exceed their turnaround radii. This
population of satellites on extreme orbits consists typically of the faint
member of a satellite pair that has been ejected onto a highly-energetic orbit
during its first approach to the primary. Since the concurrent accretion of
multiple satellite systems is a defining feature of hierarchical models of
galaxy formation, we speculate that this three-body ejection mechanism may be
the origin of (i) some of the newly discovered high-speed satellites around M31
(such as Andromeda XIV); (ii) some of the distant fast-receding Local Group
members, such as Leo I; and (iii) the oddly isolated dwarf spheroidals Cetus
and Tucana in the outskirts of the Local Group. Our results suggest that care
must be exercised when using the orbits of the most weakly bound satellites to
place constraints on the total mass of the Local Group.

transitions of the baryon antidecuplet within the framework of the chiral
quark-soliton model. The dynamical model parameters are fixed by experimental

decay constants, and for the singlet axial-vector constant. The transition
magnetic moments $\mu_{\Lambda\Sigma}$ and $\mu_{N\Delta}$ are well reproduced
and other octet-decuplet and octet-antidecuplet transitions are predicted. In
particular, the present calculation of $\mu_{\Sigma\Sigma^*}$ is found to be
below the upper bound $0.82\mu_N$ that the SELEX collaboration measured very
recently. The results explains consistently the recent findings of a new $N^*$
resonance from the GRAAL and Tohoku LNS group. We also obtain the transition
axial-vector constants for the $\Theta^+\to KN$ from which the decay width of

HS1857+5144 display a sinusoidal variation with a period of Porb=383.52 min and
peak-to-peak amplitudes of 0.7 mag and 1.1 mag in the B-band and R-band,

reflection effect on the heated inner hemisphere of the companion star,
suggesting a very high temperature of the white dwarf. Our radial velocity
study confirms the photometric period as the orbital period of the system. A
model atmosphere fit to the spectrum of the white dwarf obtained at minimum
light provides limits to its mass and temperature of Mwd=~0.6-1.0 Msun and
Twd=~70000-100000 K, respectively. The detection of HeII 4686 absorption
classifies the primary star of HS1857+5144 as a DAO white dwarf. Combining the
results from our spectroscopy and photometry, we estimate the mass of the
companion star and the binary inclination to be Msec=~0.15-0.30 Msun and
i=~45-55 deg, respectively. We classify HS1857+5144 as one of the youngest
pre-CV known to date. The cooling age of the white dwarf suggests that the

attain this, first we translate the network adapting it to a weighted graph

corresponds to the multidimensional cost of sending a packet on the related
network link: each component of the weights vector represents a different QoS
metric value (e.g. bandwidth, cost, delay, packet loss). The second step
consists in writing this graph as a program in Soft Constraint Logic
Programming (SCLP): the engine of this framework is then able to find the best
paths/trees by optimizing their costs and solving the constraints imposed on
them (e.g. delay < 40msec), thus finding a solution to QoS routing problems.
Moreover, c-semiring structures are a convenient tool to model QoS metrics. At
last, we provide an implementation of the framework over scale-free networks
and we suggest how the performance can be improved.

that the phase of the de Broglie waves further extended for stationary
particles is a relativistic invariant being the same for all corresponding
observers. Also the phase of the electromagnetic waves transporting energy at
light speed is a relativistic invariant. Therefore the universe and its matter

critically examined. The issue is of significance ever since Runge and Gross
(Phys. Rev. Lett. 52, 997 (1984)) established the uniqueness of the mapping,

argue that besides existence (so called v-representability) and uniqueness
there is an important question of stability and chaos. Studying a 2-level
system we find innocent, almost constant densities that cannot be constructed
from any potential (non-existence). We further show via a Lyapunov analysis
that the mapping of densities on potentials has chaotic regions in this case.
In real space the situation is more subtle. V-representability is formally
assured but the mapping is often chaotic making the actual construction of the
potential almost impossible. The chaotic nature of the mapping, studied for the
first time here, has serious consequences regarding the possibility of using
TDDFT in real-time settings.

flavors, u and d, are characterized by masses small compared to the fundamental
scale of this theory. Measurements sensitive to the orbital angular momenta of
the color constituents of the nucleon display the interplay of chiral dynamics
and confinement in a unique manner. This pageant can be explored by an
evaluation, within the context of the Georgi-Manohar chiral quark model, of the
normalization of the orbital structure functions and the normalization of the
Boer-Mulders functions for different quark flavors. The resolution structures

long standing theoretical debate. According to the so called Mermin-Wagner
theorem, long wavelength fluctuations destroy the long-range order for 2D
crystals. Similarly, 2D membranes embedded in a 3D space have a tendency to be
crumpled. These dangerous fluctuations can, however, be suppressed by
anharmonic coupling between bending and stretching modes making that a
two-dimensional membrane can exist but should present strong height
fluctuations. The discovery of graphene, the first truly 2D crystal and the
recent experimental observation of ripples in freely hanging graphene makes
these issues especially important. Beside the academic interest, understanding
the mechanisms of stability of graphene is crucial for understanding electronic
transport in this material that is attracting so much interest for its unusual
Dirac spectrum and electronic properties. Here we address the nature of these
height fluctuations by means of straightforward atomistic Monte Carlo
simulations based on a very accurate many-body interatomic potential for
carbon. We find that ripples spontaneously appear due to thermal fluctuations
with a size distribution peaked around 70 \AA which is compatible with
experimental findings (50-100 \AA) but not with the current understanding of
stability of flexible membranes. This unexpected result seems to be due to the
multiplicity of chemical bonding in carbon.

0704.1799,Super Low Traction under EHD and Mixed Lubrication Regimes,,"Superlubricity, Elsevier BV (Ed.) (31/03/2007) 429-445",,,['physics.class-ph'],,"  After the pioneered experimental works on superlubricity by Martin et al. on
MoS2 [1], Hirano et al. on tungsten and silicon [2] and the further
confirmation by Dienwiebel et al. on graphite [3], many groups around the word
investigated the occurrence of near frictionless sliding contacts. This large
mobilization of tribologists, material sciences specialists and physicists has
lead to emerging solutions involving new materials and coatings, the most
promising being carbon based like graphite, diamond, carbon composites or
diamond-like-carbons. Some of them are currently used in practical
applications. The situation is different especially in EHL: the highest
friction coefficients are close to 10% when traction fluids are involved, i.e.
fluids that have especially designed to transmit the highest friction, and they
vary within 3-6% for the rest of lubricants. The range of variation is
consequently very narrow and these typical values are really low compared to
those obtained in dry contacts: as a consequence the gain expected from a super
low traction regime in lubrication will be probably more limited, especially in
the case of experiments conducted at the meso or macro scales. This weak
perspective could be one explanation on the relatively low number of articles
in recent literature dealing with lubricated superlubricity in the above
conditions.

universal properties if the interparticle spacing r_o greatly exceeds the range

depend only on r_o (or, equivalently, the energy E_{FG} of the free Fermi gas).
This paper investigates Bose and Fermi systems with non-vanishing angular
momentum l using the lowest order constrained variational method. We focus on
the regime where the generalized scattering length becomes large and determine
the relevant length scales. For Bose gases with large generalized scattering
lengths, we obtain simple expressions for the energy per particle in terms of a
l-dependent length scale \xi_l, which depends on the range of the underlying
two-body potential and the average interparticle spacing. We discuss possible

between the data being consistent with instrument noise alone, or instrument
noise and a gravitational wave signal. The analysis of data from ground based
gravitational wave detectors is mostly conducted using classical statistics,
and methods such as the Neyman-Pearson criteria are used for model selection.
Future space based detectors, such as the \emph{Laser Interferometer Space
Antenna} (LISA), are expected to produced rich data streams containing the
signals from many millions of sources. Determining the number of sources that
are resolvable, and the most appropriate description of each source poses a
challenging model selection problem that may best be addressed in a Bayesian
framework. An important class of LISA sources are the millions of low-mass
binary systems within our own galaxy, tens of thousands of which will be
detectable. Not only are the number of sources unknown, but so are the number
of parameters required to model the waveforms. For example, a significant
subset of the resolvable galactic binaries will exhibit orbital frequency
evolution, while a smaller number will have measurable eccentricity. In the
Bayesian approach to model selection one needs to compute the Bayes factor
between competing models. Here we explore various methods for computing Bayes
factors in the context of determining which galactic binaries have measurable
frequency evolution. The methods explored include a Reverse Jump Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) algorithm, Savage-Dickie density ratios, the Schwarz-Bayes

methods on up to 512**3 computional grid points. DNS results for particle
concentration and enstrophy at Taylor microscale Reynolds numbers in the range
34 - 170 were used to directly determine multiplier distributions (PDFs) on
spatial scales 3 times the Kolmogorov length scale. The width of the PDFs,
which is a measure of intermittency, decreases with increasing mass loading
within the local region where the multipliers are measured. The functional form
of this dependence is not sensitive to Reynolds numbers in the range
considered. A partition correlation probability is included in the cascade
model to account for the observed spatial anticorrelation between particle
concentration and enstrophy. Joint probability distribution functions of
concentration and enstrophy generated using the cascade model are shown to be
in excellent agreement with those derived directly from our 3D simulations.
Probabilities predicted by the cascade model are presented at Reynolds numbers
well beyond what is achievable by direct simulation. These results clearly
indicate that particle mass loading significantly reduces the probabilities of
high particle concentration and enstrophy relative to those resulting from
unloaded runs. Particle mass density appears to reach a limit at around 100
times the gas density. This approach has promise for significant computational
savings in certain applications.

optimal as both source and channel codes when encoding and decoding are
performed optimally. More precisely, in the context of lossy compression, we
prove that finite degree constructions can achieve any pair $(R, D)$ on the

localized near the UV brane. Such models are conjectured to be dual to 4D
strong dynamics triggering EWSB. The motivation for such a study is that a
negative value of S can significantly ameliorate the constraints from
electroweak precision data on these models, allowing lower mass scales (TeV or
below) for the new particles and leading to easier discovery at the LHC. We
first extend an earlier proof of S>0 for EWSB by boundary conditions in
arbitrary metric to the case of general kinetic functions for the gauge fields
or arbitrary kinetic mixing. We then consider EWSB in the bulk by a Higgs VEV
showing that S is positive for arbitrary metric and Higgs profile, assuming
that the effects from higher-dimensional operators in the 5D theory are
sub-leading and can therefore be neglected. For the specific case of AdS_5 with
a power law Higgs profile, we also show that S ~ + O(1), including effects of
possible kinetic mixing from higher-dimensional operator (of NDA size) in the
$5D$ theory. Therefore, our work strongly suggests that S is positive in
calculable models in extra dimensions.

Cepheids using the interferometric Baade Wesselink method (IBWM). The precision
of this technique is currently limited by interferometric measurements at the
1.5% level. At this level, the center-to-limb darkening (CLD) and the presence
of circumstellar envelopes (CSE) seem to be the two main sources of bias. The
observations we performed aim at improving our knowledge of the interferometric
visibility profile of Cepheids. In particular, we assess the systematic
presence of CSE around Cepheids in order determine accurate distances with the
IBWM free from CSE biased angular diameters. We observed a Cepheid (Y Oph) for
which the pulsation is well resolved and a non-pulsating yellow supergiant
(alpha Per) using long-baseline near-infrared interferometry. We interpreted
these data using a simple CSE model we previously developed. We found that our
observations of alpha Per do not provide evidence for a CSE. The measured CLD
is explained by an hydrostatic photospheric model. Our observations of Y Oph,
when compared to smaller baseline measurements, suggest that it is surrounded
by a CSE with similar characteristics to CSE found previously around other
Cepheids. We have determined the distance to Y Oph to be d=491+/-18 pc.
Additional evidence points toward the conclusion that most Cepheids are
surrounded by faint CSE, detected by near infrared interferometry: after
observing four Cepheids, all show evidence for a CSE. Our CSE non-detection
around a non-pulsating supergiant in the instability strip, alpha Per, provides
confidence in the detection technique and suggests a pulsation driven mass-loss
mechanism for the Cepheids.

tail (finite variance) out-degree distribution, then the corresponding
in-degree one behaves as $k^{-3}$. Moreover, for an out-degree distribution
with a scale invariant tail, $P_{out}(k)\sim k^{-\alpha}$, the corresponding
in-degree distribution has exactly the same asymptotic behavior only if
$2<\alpha<3$ (infinite variance). Similar results are obtained when
attractiveness is included. We also present some results on descriptive
statistics measures %descriptive statistics such as the correlation between the
number of in-going links, $D_{in}$, and outgoing links, $D_{out}$, and the
conditional expectation of $D_{in}$ given $D_{out}$, and we calculate these

heating from plastic flow predicted using the Steinberg-Guinan model. Plastic
flow was calculated self-consistently with the shock jump conditions: this is
necessary for a rigorous estimate of the locus of shock states accessible. The
temperatures obtained were significantly higher than predicted assuming ideal
hydrodynamic loading. The temperatures were compared with surface emission
spectrometry measurements for Mo shocked to around 60GPa and then released into
vacuum or into a LiF window. Shock loading was induced by the impact of a
planar projectile, accelerated by high explosive or in a gas gun. Surface
velocimetry showed an elastic wave at the start of release from the shocked
state; the amplitude of the elastic wave matched the prediction to around 10%,
indicating that the predicted flow stress in the shocked state was reasonable.
The measured temperatures were consistent with the simulations, indicating that
the fraction of plastic work converted to heat was in the range 70-100% for
these loading conditions.

value. In 2d geometry, excluded volume interactions between monomers of a chain
confined inside a strip of finite length 2L transform the coil conformation
into a linear string of blobs. However, the blob picture raises questions on
the nature of this escape transition. To check the theoretical predictions
based on the blob picture we study 2d single polymer chains with excluded
volume interactions and with one end grafted in the middle of a strip of length
  2L and width H by simulating self-avoiding walks on a square lattice with the

stellar bulge masses (Mbulge) and there are several ideas to explain the origin
of this relationship. This study isolates the role of galaxy mergers from
considerations of other detailed physics to more clearly show how a linear
BH-galaxy mass relation (MBH-Mgal) can naturally emerge regardless of how
primordial BHs were seeded inside galaxies, if the galaxy mass function
declines with increasing mass. Under this circumstance, the MBH-Mgal relation
is a passive attractor that eventually converges to a tight linear relation
because of two basic statistical effects: a central limit-like tendency for
galaxy mergers which is much stronger for major mergers than minor mergers, and
a convergence toward a linear relation that is due mainly to minor mergers. A
curious consequence of this thought experiment is that, if galaxy bulges are
formed by major mergers, then merging statistics naturally show that MBH would
correlate more strongly with bulge dominated galaxies, because of stronger
central-seeking tendencies, than with disk dominated galaxies. Even if some
other physics is ultimately responsible for causing a linear MBH-Mbulge
relationship, this thought experiment shows that, counter to intuition, random
merging of galaxies that harbor random BH masses tends to strengthen rather
than weaken a pre-existing, linear, correlation. This idea may be generalized
to other gravitationally bound systems (dark matter halo, compact nuclear
objects) that retain their physical identities after experiencing mergers.

  Local Pseudopotentials",To be published in Phys. Rev. B,,10.1103/PhysRevB.75.205122,,"['cond-mat.str-el', 'cond-mat.mtrl-sci']",,"  In the density functional (DF) theory of Kohn and Sham, the kinetic energy of
the ground state of a system of noninteracting electrons in a general external
field is calculated using a set of orbitals. Orbital free methods attempt to
calculate this directly from the electron density by approximating the
universal but unknown kinetic energy density functional. However simple local
approximations are inaccurate and it has proved very difficult to devise
generally accurate nonlocal approximations. We focus instead on the kinetic
potential, the functional derivative of the kinetic energy DF, which appears in
the Euler equation for the electron density. We argue that the kinetic
potential is more local and more amenable to simple physically motivated
approximations in many relevant cases, and describe two pathways by which the
value of the kinetic energy can be efficiently calculated. We propose two
nonlocal orbital free kinetic potentials that reduce to known exact forms for
both slowly varying and rapidly varying perturbations and also reproduce exact
results for the linear response of the density of the homogeneous system to
small perturbations. A simple and systematic approach for generating accurate
and weak ab-initio local pseudopotentials which produce a smooth slowly varying
valence component of the electron density is proposed for use in orbital free
DF calculations of molecules and solids. The use of these local
pseudopotentials further minimizes the possible errors from the kinetic
potentials. Our theory yields results for the total energies and ionization
energies of atoms, and for the shell structure in the atomic radial density
profiles that are in very good agreement with calculations using the full
Kohn-Sham theory.

powerful tools of conformal field theory in the case of critical evolution.
Several results are obtained in generic dimension in the gaussian (mean-field)

some solvable models that allows also to understand which features are valid
beyond the critical evolution.
  All our findings may be explained in terms of a picture generally valid,
whereby quasiparticles, entangled over regions of the order of the correlation

number of randomized algorithms. Here we explore the effects of choice on
models of tree and network growth. In our models each new node has k randomly
chosen contacts, where k > 1 is a constant. It then attaches to whichever one
of these contacts is most desirable in some sense, such as its distance from
the root or its degree. Even when the new node has just two choices, i.e., when
k=2, the resulting network can be very different from a random graph or tree.
For instance, if the new node attaches to the contact which is closest to the
root of the tree, the distribution of depths changes from Poisson to a
traveling wave solution. If the new node attaches to the contact with the
smallest degree, the degree distribution is closer to uniform than in a random
graph, so that with high probability there are no nodes in the network with
degree greater than O(log log N). Finally, if the new node attaches to the
contact with the largest degree, we find that the degree distribution is a
power law with exponent -1 up to degrees roughly equal to k, with an
exponential cutoff beyond that; thus, in this case, we need k >> 1 to see a
power law over a wide range of degrees.

  populations",,BMC Biology 5:29 (2007),10.1186/1741-7007-5-29,,"['q-bio.PE', 'q-bio.BM']",,"  BACKGROUND: An important question is whether evolution favors properties such
as mutational robustness or evolvability that do not directly benefit any
individual, but can influence the course of future evolution. Functionally
similar proteins can differ substantially in their robustness to mutations and
capacity to evolve new functions, but it has remained unclear whether any of
these differences might be due to evolutionary selection for these properties.
  RESULTS: Here we use laboratory experiments to demonstrate that evolution
favors protein mutational robustness if the evolving population is sufficiently
large. We neutrally evolve cytochrome P450 proteins under identical selection
pressures and mutation rates in populations of different sizes, and show that
proteins from the larger and thus more polymorphic population tend towards
higher mutational robustness. Proteins from the larger population also evolve
greater stability, a biophysical property that is known to enhance both
mutational robustness and evolvability. The excess mutational robustness and
stability is well described by existing mathematical theories, and can be
quantitatively related to the way that the proteins occupy their neutral
network.
  CONCLUSIONS: Our work is the first experimental demonstration of the general
tendency of evolution to favor mutational robustness and protein stability in
highly polymorphic populations. We suggest that this phenomenon may contribute
to the mutational robustness and evolvability of viruses and bacteria that
exist in large populations.

integral conservation rules similar to the Barnett-Loudon sum rule but ocurring

frequency intervals are regular. For the potential barriers, only non-periodic

contributions are suppressed by lambda N^2 where N denotes the number of

expectation, which is due to the infrared enhancement of scalar vacuum
fluctuations characterising de Sitter space. Since observations constrain
lambda to be very small lambda ~ 10^(-12) and N ~ 50-60, the quantum

correlation effects on the band structure of oxide systems. We choose MgO as a
prototype closed-shell ionic oxide. Our analysis is based on a local
Hamiltonian approach and performed on finite fragments cut from the infinite
solid. Localized Wannier functions and embedding potentials are obtained from
prior periodic Hartree-Fock (HF) calculations. We investigate the role of
various electron correlation effects in reducing the HF band gap and modifying
the band widths. On-site and nearest-neighbor charge relaxation as well as
long-range polarization effects are calculated. Whereas correlation effects are
essential for computing accurate band gaps, we found that they produce smaller
changes on the HF band widths, at least for this material. Surprisingly, a
broadening effect is obtained for the O 2p valence bands. The ab initio data
are in good agreement with the energy gap and band width derived from
thermoreflectance and x-ray photoemission experiments. The results show that
the wavefunction based approach applied here allows for well controlled
approximations and a transparent identification of the microscopic processes
which determine the electronic band structure.

highly-evolved, variable, intermediate-mass (4-6 Msun) AGB stars in the LMC and
SMC in order to look for C, N and O variations that are expected to arise from
third dredge-up and hot-bottom burning. The pulsation of the objects has been
modelled, yielding stellar masses, and spectral synthesis calculations have
been performed in order to derive abundances from the observed spectra. For two
stars, abundances of C, N, O, Na, Al, Ti, Sc and Fe were derived and compared
with the abundances predicted by detailed AGB models. Both stars show very
large N enhancements and C deficiencies. These results provide the first
observational confirmation of the long-predicted production of primary nitrogen
by the combination of third dredge-up and hot-bottom burning in
intermediate-mass AGB stars. It was not possible to derive abundances for the
remaining five stars: three were too cool to model, while another two had
strong shocks in their atmospheres which caused strong emission to fill the
line cores and made abundance determination impossible. The latter occurrence
allows us to predict the pulsation phase interval during which observations
should be made if successful abundance analysis is to be possible.

low-amplitude stellar variability contributed by a variety of physical
processes. We discuss in detail the periodic flux modulations arising from the
tidal force on the star due to a substellar companion. An analytic expression
for the variability is derived in the equilibrium-tide approximation. We
demonstrate analytically and through numerical solutions of the linear,
nonadiabatic stellar oscillation equations that the equilibrium-tide formula
works extremely well for stars of mass <1.4 Msun with thick surface convection
zones. More massive stars with largely radiative envelopes do not conform to
the equilibrium-tide approximation and can exhibit flux variations $\ga$10
times larger than naive estimates. Over the full range of stellar masses
considered, we treat the oscillatory response of the convection zone by
adapting a prescription that A. J. Brickhill developed for pulsating white
dwarfs. Compared to other sources of periodic variability, the ellipsoidal
lightcurve has a distinct dependence on time and system parameters. We suggest
that ellipsoidal oscillations induced by giant planets may be detectable from
as many as ~100 of the 10^5 Kepler target stars. (Abridged)

to determine the ratio of MT shear and stretch moduli ($\approx

katanin (10's of pN). For many motors acting on a single MT we derive
expressions for the end-to-end distance reduction and provide criteria for

latter causes gradual drifting of the orbits of km-sized asteroids and plays an
important role in the delivery of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) from the main
belt and in the dynamical spreading of asteroid families. At present, very
little is known about the thermal inertia of asteroids in the km size range.
Here we show that the average thermal inertia of a sample of NEAs in the

we identify a trend of increasing thermal inertia with decreasing asteroid
diameter, D. This indicates that the dependence of the drift rate of the
orbital semimajor axis on the size of asteroids due to the Yarkovsky effect is
a more complex function than the generally adopted D^(&#8722;1) dependence, and
that the size distribution of objects injected by Yarkovsky-driven orbital
mobility into the NEA source regions is less skewed to smaller sizes than
generally assumed. We discuss how this fact may help to explain the small
difference in the slope of the size distribution of km-sized NEAs and main-belt
asteroids.

observe a Navier-Stokes (NS) inertial range followed by a 2nd LANS inertial
range. The analysis of the third-order structure function scaling supports the
predicted l^3 scaling; it corresponds to a k^(-1) scaling of the energy
spectrum. The energy spectrum itself shows a different scaling which goes as
k^1. This latter spectrum is consistent with the absence of stretching in the
sub-filter scales due to the Taylor frozen-in hypothesis employed as a closure
in the derivation of LANS. These two scalings are conjectured to coexist in
different spatial portions of the flow. The l^3 (E(k) k^(-1)) scaling is
subdominant to k^1 in the energy spectrum, but the l^3 scaling is responsible
for the direct energy cascade, as no cascade can result from motions with no
internal degrees of freedom. We verify the prediction for the size of the LANS
attractor resulting from this scaling. From this, we give a methodology either
for arriving at grid-independent solutions for LANS, or for obtaining a
formulation of a LES optimal in the context of the alpha models. The fully
converged grid-independent LANS may not be the best approximation to a direct
numerical simulation of the NS equations since the minimum error is a balance
between truncation errors and the approximation error due to using LANS instead
of the primitive equations. Furthermore, the small-scale behavior of LANS
contributes to a reduction of flux at constant energy, leading to a shallower
energy spectrum for large alpha. These small-scale features, do not preclude
LANS to reproduce correctly the intermittency properties of high Re flow.

fields affect the collapse dynamics and explore how the properties of the
black-hole formations and neutrino emissions could be affected. As for the
microphysics, we employ a realistic equation of state and approximate the
neutrino transfer by a multiflavour leakage scheme. With these computations, we
find that the jet-like explosions are obtained by the magnetodriven shock waves
if the initial magnetic field is as large as $10^{12}$ G. We point out that the
black-hole masses at the formation decrease with the initial field strength, on
the other hand, increase with the initial rotation rates. As for the neutrino
properties, we point out that the degree of the differential rotation plays an
important role to determine which species of the neutrino luminosity is more
dominant than the others. Furthermore, we find that the stronger magnetic
fields make the peak neutrino luminosities smaller, because the magnetic
pressure acts to halt the collapse in the central regions, leading to the
suppression of the releasable gravitational binding energies.

line region obey a simple relation of the type R=a L^g, from faint Seyfert
nuclei to bright quasars, allowing single-epoch determination of the central
black hole mass M=b L^g D^2 from their luminosity L and width of H_beta
emission line. Adopting this mass determination for cosmological studies
requires the extrapolation to high z and L of a relation whose calibration
relies so far on reverberation mapping measurements performed for L<10^46 erg/s
and z<0.4. We initiated a campaign for the monitoring of a few luminous,
intermediate z quasars whose apparent magnitude V<15.7 allows observations with
a 1.8m telescope, aimed at proving that emission lines vary and respond to
continuum variations even for luminosities >10^47 erg/s, and determining
eventually their M_BH from reverberation mapping. We have repeatedly performed
simultaneous observations of quasars and reference stars to determine relative
variability of continuum and emission lines. We describe the observations and
methods of analysis. For the quasars PG1634+706 and PG1247+268 we obtain
light-curves respectively for CIII], MgII and for CIV, CIII] emission lines
with the relevant continua. During 3.2 years of observation, in the former case
no continuum variability has been detected and the evidence for line
variability is marginal, while in the latter case both continuum and line
variability are detected with high significance and the line variations appear
correlated with continuum variations. The detection of the emission line
variability in a quasar with L~10^47 erg/s encourages the prosecution of the
campaign which should provide a black hole mass estimate in other 5-6 years,
constraining the M_BH-L relation in a poorly explored range of luminosity.

are two dimension-5 interactions, each of which has previously been treated
separately for a pseudo-scalar or a scalar particle. By following the evolution
in an external magnetic field of the system of spin-zero particles and photons,
we compute the changes in light polarization and the transition probability for
two experimental set-ups: one-way propagation and round-trip propagation. While
the first may be relevant for astrophysical sources of spin-zero particles, the
second applies to laboratory optical experiments like PVLAS. In the one-way
propagation, interesting phenomena can occur for special configurations of
polarization where, for instance, transition occurs but light polarization does
not change. For the round-trip propagation, however, the standard results of
polarization changes for a pseudoscalar or a scalar are only modified by a
factor that depends on the relative strength of the two interactions.

relativity with candidate galaxies close to a binary black hole merger. In this
paper we identify the typical mass ratio of the two black holes but then show
that the distance when gravitational radiation becomes the dominant dissipative
effect (over dynamical friction) does not depend on the mass ratio. However the
dynamical evolution in the gravitational wave emission regime does. For the
typical range of mass ratios the final stage of the merger is preceded by a
rapid precession and a subsequent spin-flip of the main black hole. This
already occurs in the inspiral phase, therefore can be described analytically
by post-Newtonian techniques. We then identify the radio galaxies with a
super-disk as those in which the rapidly precessing jet produces effectively a
powerful wind, entraining the environmental gas to produce the appearance of a
thick disk. These specific galaxies are thus candidates for a merger of two
black holes to happen in the astronomically near future.

Each cash flow is modelled by a random variable that can be expressed as a
function of a collection of independent random variables called market factors.
With each such ""X-factor"" we associate a market information process, the values
of which are accessible to market agents. Each information process is a sum of
two terms; one contains true information about the value of the market factor;
the other represents ""noise"". The noise term is modelled by an independent
Brownian bridge. The market filtration is assumed to be that generated by the
aggregate of the independent information processes. The price of an asset is
given by the expectation of the discounted cash flows in the risk-neutral
measure, conditional on the information provided by the market filtration. When
the cash flows are the dividend payments associated with equities, an explicit
model is obtained for the share-price, and the prices of options on
dividend-paying assets are derived. Remarkably, the resulting formula for the
